I am saying it is completely 100% obvious that he makes jokes. For example, the comments at the rally.

>I mean, can you admit it looks bad that your defense was that he was joking.. and he came out and said he was not joking?

No. He didn't say it wasn't joking. He made a dismissive comment. What looks bad is for your side to now declare nothing Trump says is a joke, ever.

I don't see how your side is so stupid not to get this. Let's say I'm in a meeting at work:

This is how you do it. @JoeBiden/@TheDemocrats are eating Trump's lunch on how to hold a convention in 2020:
1- Keep promise to accept nomination in WI
2- Innovate/bring in people from outside politics to produce new convention experience
3- Don't kill people in the process

People laugh/mock when Lis said the convention was outdated and needed to be revamped. Now the DNC are changing the traditional format to something else. Biden still intends to accept the nomination in Wis. The DNC needs top level production to have this event be success in the virtual aspect.

> It could in theory all change, or at least get a lot more interesting, but right now Donald Trump has become a clear 2020 underdog, and his situation could just as easily get worse instead of better. In the end we may realize that Trump’s mojo depended on his ability to pose as an insurgent outsider, and wasn’t transferable to an environment in which he was called upon to govern. And he may yet try, somehow, to run against the status quo for which he is now responsible. His 2016 upset is going to be a very tough act to follow.

from my vantage point events appear to be getting worse almost by daily for dr donnie. for example, the last 2 rallies, the latter was for young evangelical know-nothings and the former was a near no-show -- and now, record high cv19 spikes are occurring thru out the sunbelt (his base) and his stupid ag just got hosed by 2 whistleblowers.  i mean, just how bad is it going to get for him   ...probably worse from what we see now.",wonderingsocrates,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/hfbdex/trump_is_now_the_2020_underdog/fvwhxaf/,2020-06-24T23:01:05Z,"","",,,

Only if you conflate the definitions of liberal and leftist politics. Imperialism isnt very left wing. Selling out to wall street isnt left wing. Forcing citizens to purchase a service from a private entity for the sole reason of being alive isnt left wing.  





  >With recent online usage of the term leftist there definitely isn't anyone noticeable in US politics advocating for that.


My usage of leftist isnt recent nor is it exclusively an online phenomena. The US is overwhelmingly liberal and right wing politically and as such the ""window"" of politics heavily leans right to the point that simply having the government do stuff gets you called a socialist.  If you support capitalist production and are not openly reactionary you are a liberal not left. 



  >  If we don't take a eurocentric view I'd think the US is at least moderately to the left of center.  


It objectively isnt. Labor is suppressed and coopted by corporate interests and imperialism reigns supreme. 




>Fortunately Biden is more left than the US center


If you truly believe that he plans on trying to execute a ""left of center"" platform Ive got a bridge to sell you.

2020-06-24T23:02:01Z,socialgist," Foi preciso trocar a metáfora para tentar explicar o aumento de novos casos de contaminação por [coronavírus ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/cotidiano/coronavirus/)em mais da metade dos EUA.

 Especialistas e técnicos do governo americano substituíram [a tese de que uma forte segunda onda vai atingir o país até o fim do ano](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2020/06/nos-eua-12-estados-batem-recorde-de-covid-19-e-casa-branca-se-prepara-para-2a-onda.shtml) pela ideia de que haverá novos surtos em várias regiões, em uma espécie de incêndio que pode se alastrar até depois de dezembro.

 A intensidade e a extensão das chamas —que podem se espalhar caso não sejam controladas— vão depender da capacidade de testagem e[ do processo de reabertura econômica, que já está em curso em todos os 50 estados americanos.](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2020/06/apos-reabertura-estados-mais-populosos-dos-eua-tem-altas-recordes-de-casos-diarios-de-coronavirus.shtml)

 Regiões que não reendurecerem suas regras de higiene e distanciamento social em meio aos repiques, por exemplo, devem ser mais impactadas e se tornar um problema para o restante do país.

 ""Temos que parar de pensar em ondas. No lugar disso, imaginaria um incêndio que cresce em brasas. Se essas brasas pousam num lugar onde as pessoas não estão tomando o cuidado necessário, essas brasas explodem"", afirma John Swartzberg, especialista em doenças infecciosas da Universidade da Califórnia em Berkeley.

  [Líderes da pandemia no mundo](https://aovivo.folha.uol.com.br/equilibrioesaude/2020/06/22/5913-acompanhe-todas-as-informacoes-sobre-a-pandemia-de-coronavirus.shtml#post402374), os EUA registram mais de 2,3 milhões de casos e 121 mil mortes por Covid-19.

 De acordo com levantamento do jornal The New York Times, 26 dos 50 estados americanos tiveram aumento sustentado de novos casos da doença nos últimos 14 dias —mesmo depois de o país ter registrado tendência nacional de queda no fim do mês passado.

 Apesar do temor de que os protestos que reuniram multidões contra o racismo pudessem contribuir para que esses números subissem ainda mais, especialistas ouvidos pela **Folha** dizem que a situação piorou principalmente em estados que [retomaram as atividades ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2020/06/apple-fecha-lojas-nos-eua-apos-aumento-do-numero-de-casos-de-coronavirus.shtml)de forma prematura ou naqueles que ainda não haviam sido atingidos de vez pela pandemia.

 ""O que estamos vendo atualmente é o aumento de novos casos em estados que nunca foram realmente bloqueados e estão reabrindo sem nunca terem reduzido muito a transmissão"", diz o epidemiologista Arnold Monto, da Universidade de Michigan.

 ""Não é uma segunda onda, são crises onde pessoas que estão em um lugar com algum grau de transmissão se reúnem e passam muito tempo sem máscaras.""

 Os [quadros mais preocupantes estão no sul e na costa oeste dos EUA](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/colunas/paulkrugman/2020/06/uma-praga-de-ignorancia-deliberada.shtml), como Oklahoma, Missouri, Arizona, Flórida e Texas, que chegou a registrar 5.400 novos casos em um único dia nesta semana.

 Governados por republicanos, do partido do presidente [Donald Trump](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2020/06/trump-usa-crise-nos-eua-para-promover-sua-marca-de-autoritarismo.shtml), esses estados retomaram suas atividades no início de maio, ainda sem ampla capacidade de fazer testes e de monitorar novos casos.

 Nesta semana, a Flórida chegou a mais de 100 mil casos, o Texas, 119 mil, e o Arizona, 54,7 mil. Missouri aparece com 18,7 mil casos e Oklahoma, 10,7 mil.

 Governada por um democrata, a Califórnia foi um dos primeiros estados a entrar em quarentena nos EUA e também figura entre os que registram aumento nos novos casos. Especialistas tentam entender as razões para os picos nesse cenário —além da reabertura em andamento, que incluiu parques e praias, demografia e densidade populacional devem entram na conta, assim como a realização de testes.

 O maior número de testes é usado como argumento pelas autoridades estaduais —e também por Trump— para o justificar o aumento de casos, mas especialistas dizem que só isso não é suficiente para explicar os repiques, já que as hospitalizações e a porcentagem de testagem positiva também aumentaram em comparação com os níveis anteriores.

 [Durante um comício em Oklahoma no fim de semana](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2020/06/trump-diz-que-brasileiros-nao-estao-muito-bem-no-combate-ao-coronavirus.shtml), Trump afirmou que havia orientado o governo a diminuir a testagem, para que os números de novos casos baixassem nos EUA.

 Três dias depois, Anthony Fauci, diretor do Instituto de Doenças Infecciosas e um dos especialistas mais respeitados do país, desmentiu o chefe.

 Em sessão no Congresso nesta terça-feira (23), Fauci, que integra a força-tarefa sobre coronavírus na Casa Branca, disse a parlamentares que não recebeu nenhuma orientação de Trump para diminuir os testes. ""É o oposto. Vamos fazer mais testes, e não menos.""

 O médico do governo americano disse ainda que tem visto ""um aumento perturbador de infecções"" em vários estados e que os próximos dias ""serão cruciais para observar como vamos endereçar as questões [sobre controle dos repiques], principalmente no Arizona, na Flórida e no Texas.""

 O consenso entre os especialistas é que, caso não sejam controlados, esses picos podem se espalhar por outras regiões e atingir inclusive estados que já passaram pelo pior e começaram sua reabertura de forma gradual, como Nova York, com mais de 393 mil casos e quase 31 mil mortes.

  

 No estado mais atingido pela pandemia dos EUA, os nova-iorquinos cumpriram uma rigorosa quarentena de quase três meses e iniciaram a reabertura somente em 8 de junho.

 Na cidade de Washington, por sua vez, a segunda fase de retomada econômica começou na segunda-feira (22), depois de alguns picos de novos casos, seguidos de uma tendência de queda.

 Além da capital, 15 estados americanos registram baixa nos novos casos nas últimas duas semanas.

 Especialistas e autoridades já projetavam os repiques diante da reabertura, mas como esses picos têm ou não sido controlados é a principal preocupação a partir de agora.

 A avaliação é que, entre julho e agosto, durante o verão no hemisfério norte, as pessoas relaxem seus comportamentos. As chances de infecção ao ar livre diminuem e, por estarem fora de casa, elas podem criar uma falsa sensação de normalidade.

 Swartzberg diz que essa também pode ser uma das explicações para o fato de [os protestos não terem causado explosões de novos casos](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2020/06/george-floyd-sera-enterrado-nesta-terca-em-houston-ao-lado-de-sua-mae.shtml), como era esperado.

 ""Os atos aconteceram nas ruas, ao ar livre, onde o contágio é mais difícil. Além disso, a maioria usava máscara, o que pode nos fazer pensar que esse acessório é ainda mais importante do que a gente pensava durante essa pandemia.""

 Monto acrescenta que, em estados como Nova York e Michigan, onde os atos aconteceram ainda sob regras de quarentena e depois de níveis muito altos de contaminação, os índices estão inclusive em queda.

 Para eles, são necessárias ao menos duas medidas para impedir que esses novos picos se espalhem de maneira uniforme e ainda mais preocupante pelos EUA: mais testes e a possibilidade de retomar a quarentena em estados onde a situação está piorando.

 ""Quando observamos o número de casos e hospitalizações crescendo, mesmo que devagar, teríamos que diminuir o ritmo da reabertura econômica, esperar melhorar e, depois, abrir de novo"", diz Swartzberg.

 A tese, porém, é bloqueada pela barreira política.

 Trump diz que não vai decretar mais uma vez o fechamento dos EUA e é seguido por governadores como Ron DeSantis, da Flórida que afirma que não voltará à quarentena —ambos com medo do impacto econômico das restrições.

 Já Greg Abbott, do Texas, alarmou-se com os mais de 5.000 casos em um dia nesta semana em seu estado e pediu que as pessoas fiquem em casa depois de quase um mês e meio de reabertura.

 ""Infelizmente, aprendemos que é muito fácil reabrir, mas é bem mais difícil fechar de novo depois disso"", completa o professor de Berkeley.",williambotter,https://www.reddit.com/r/brasilnoticias/comments/hfbicw/nos_eua_medo_não_é_de_2ª_onda_mas_de_focos_de/fvwi0xg/,2020-06-24T23:02:01Z,"","",,,

gerrymandering- was created by Governor Elbridge Gerry to benefit his left wing party, it has been used by both sides for centuries.

packing the courts-  The supreme court just upheld LGBTQ rights with the majority opinion being written by Neil Gorsuch, appointed by Trump

killing the environment- both parties are very much equally culpable, on this I can expand if you want.
asking foreign governments for help- Trump did this very overtly but if you think this hasn't happened before you are naive

Schools- Obama pumped 7 billion into grants for schools, but there weren't any meaningful results, ie graduation rates and test scores didn't change

Fossil Fuels- I do think the democratic party is slightly better on this but Hillary still received millions and although Biden has now refused donations he attended a fundraiser in the fall hosted by Fossil Fuel execs.

Racists- Apart from Trump, I don't think any national politicians are really appealing to racists at this point.

I think you are really confusing Trump with all republicans at this point. You are forgetting that most republicans voted for him because he ran as an outsider, and yes he is an ""evil"" narcissist, but calling half our country ""evil"" is extremely dangerous.  You have a lot more in common with these people than Joe Biden or the Clintons.

Trump knows that this is hurting his chances but he can't do shit. Things like this clearly show that while the power of the POTUS in terms of foreign affairs and the army is virtually unlimited, internally the US is heavily federalized. The Democrat leaders of those states and cities are *hoping* for him to attempt to do something unconstitutional so they can turn the attention to him in a flash (with the help of the media), and apparently so do a significant share of state level Republicans.

So i just reapplied to get back on unemployment on like friday and certified early sunday and STILL am pending. I fear i got lumped into all these other school people that got flagged. 

MANY MANY MANY people did not get paid this pay cycle for multitude of reasons, tbh i think UNCLESAM(Trump) is tightening the grip right now because of how much money is going out.

 They dont like helping people point blank period......

I FINALLY was able to talk to someone this morning @ like 8:30am she told me that they are very backed up and that i would need to talk to a specialist(because i admitted i messed up my reported last day of work by like 4 days).... She said many many people are still pending. 

I ALSO went to the EDD Office in person and they i watched them physically put me on a list that they said someone will call me within a day so ill keep you updated. 

Bottomline, many people didnt get paid this last month, i think they are intentionally doing this knowing that the $600 is going to run out very soon and people will be suffering.

It's seeing all the bullshit generations before us have done and still have the same issues arise now, this movement is for systemic change and calling out assholes is step one. 

Debating the military budget or medical system is political debate. Calling Americans traitors and telling them to go back to their country if they hate the US isn't politics (specially cause you know... they are American), that is the hatred that has reached a boiling point for many of us and change must happen. 
I'm from San Diego and there's a fuck load of racists cum swappers around here and once Trump was elected they are not afraid to let their views spew out, they love saying ""we won"" followed by 'insert racist comment'.

> Zelinsky testified that ahead of Stone's February 20 sentencing, Timothy Shea, then the acting US Attorney for the District of Columbia, through subordinates, pushed the Stone prosecutors not to follow standard sentencing guidelines for Stone.

Also, I believe you’re horribly mistaken in your view that people wouldn’t view Trump calling it a hypothetical “Baguette Virus” as being racist. And that’s not because people just want to hate on Trump. That’s because such a statement would be pretty clearly racist/bigoted toward French people. The fact that you don’t think liberals want to point out that racism can happen to white people too? You should perhaps reconsider that stance, because no liberal I personally know feels that way. Surely there are a few loose cannons on social media that don’t think it’s possible to be racist against white people, but they’re very much in a tiny minority on the left.

> WASHINGTON - U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Wednesday it was up to Israel to decide whether to annex settlements in the occupied West Bank, as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to do despite international opposition.

> Senior aides to U.S. President Donald Trump met for a second day to discuss whether to give Netanyahu the green light for annexation, which has drawn condemnation from the Palestinians, U.S. Arab allies and other foreign governments.

> United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres urged Israel to abandon plans to annex parts of the West Bank, warning this threatened prospects for peace with the Palestinians.

> Under Trump's peace proposal unveiled in January and met with widespread skepticism, the United States would recognize the Jewish settlements - built on land the Palestinians seek for a state - as part of Israel.

> Most countries view Israel's settlements as illegal, and the Palestinians have voiced outrage at annexation.

> Among the main options under U.S. consideration is a gradual, step-by-step process in which Israel would initially declare sovereignty over several settlements close to Jerusalem instead of the 30% of the West Bank envisaged in Netanyahu's original plan, according to a person close to matter.

Is this really democracy?

The way democracy should really work is that we vote on issues and then someone who has experience with those issues gets to work on them. That would be more democratic. The candidate should not give a shit, for the most part.

>Let’s think about the FBI’s conduct in a vacuum; they interviewed him under the pretense of a friendly interdepartmental discussion, the people that interviewed him didn’t think he lied and this was after the investigation was already closed. They then threatened to prosecute his son if he didn’t make a plea deal. This is acceptable conduct to you from our law enforcement agencies?

Yes. All of those are legally allowed tactics by law enforcement. 

I do find it funny that conservatives finally are acknowledging law enforcement abuses except that most people who fight against those abuses are saying that those abuses do not occur towards the wealthy like Flynn. They happen to poor people who don't know how to fight legal battles and are given overworked public defenders. Why do the GOP rally cry over in their right for criminal justice and oversight of law enforcement? The percieved mistreatment of one of the most well-connected men in this country. 

Also the notion that Flynn's guilty plea was forced is hilarious. The concept of people being tricked into accepting guilty pleas occurs with poor people who are assigned public defenders who have little to no time to handle your case along with the lack of knowledge and intelligence by the poor person means they are more susceptible to tricks. 

Michael Flynn was not duped into pleading guilty. His first lawyer was a top notch lawyer and no top notch lawyer is going to accept a guilty plea if they believe their client was duped or tricked. Flynn wasn't some ged educated individual who was assigned a overworked public defender. It just makes zero narrative sense and it seems like grasping at straws.

Also if it was as innocent as easing tensions Flynn wouldn't feel the need to lie. And you would have to be a naive Trump bootlicker to believe Flynn telling Russian government representatives to not worry about the sanctions was anything else besides him telling them that the next adminstration is going to rip them apart.

I think they way the oligarchy will play it is they'll let ine a few more black oligarchs to put the stamp of approval on the decrepit capitalist system.

2020-06-24T23:07:09Z,socialgist,"No. Not really. Those aren't really metrics that can be measured and have an objective number assigned, at least not reasonably. If one eight year old can't explain racism genocide is still on the table? That's what ""every"" means. If the US pays one cent to a random African as reparations then that's that point off the list? We already send aid there anyway. You never specified how much, not even in the ball park. Africa being exploited is fine if it's China doing it?

Also, your metrics never stop to consider that white supremacy is not the only possible supremacy. If Jewish people have disproportionate economical and by proxy political power, does that mean you support Jewish genocide? Recently a major university, Yale iirc, was found to be discriminating against Asian applicants because Asians were disproportionately managing to take up places. They also make more money than your average white person. Should we genocide them too? Or do we blame all inequality on white people, even when it doesn't benefit them? I kinda feel you should probably have some actual numbers to point to before you start stocking up on zyklon b, but that's just my opinion as an idiot who just can't seem to understand why a global genocide is necessary. At least make a list of how much each race needs extermination, the Nazis were thoughtful enough to do that.

Have you considered Asia? Is racism there acceptable? I knew two guys from China, and they would casually state that black people were inferior as if it was an accepted fact. There have been reports that the Chinese government is blaming black people for covid, even Donald trump is generally less openly racist than that. Do you wanna start a nuclear war to genocide them too?

I specifically asked for measurable numbers. Otherwise it's just emotion-. Again, I'm gonna get a little picky about accuracy when you're trying to justify genocide.

We're already in a recession.  But we can literally avoid the consequences of recession - namely, [poverty](https://slate.com/business/2020/06/coronavirus-economy-poverty-rate.html) but continuing to send checks to Americans.  Trump, to his credit, has some instincts on this (much of it is self-preservation) but it remains to be seen whether his instincts (keep the people happy) will win out over the GOP (reduce deficit spending, creative destruction, let the economy sort itself out).

This is actually a big deal, and it's not a small difference between the two.  If Trump feels that his reelection chances are at risk by cutting back on government spending, its possible that he goes against GOP conventional wisdom.

>Sure, but none of that is going away anytime soon. Trump can wear a mask for every public appearance from now until November, and I don't think it would change much apart from losing him some votes -- idiot kids are still gonna party at poolside bars and the ""freedom"" crowd is still going to act like store policies requiring

3. wikileaks was being fed Russian intel by fictional composite character Guccifer 2.0, which was really a group of FSB agents, unmasked by Dutch intel through a camera hack.

4. DOJ just tried to cut Stone's sentence, in ""political interference"", according to recent testimony.

5. Mueller was absolute in the assertion  that Russia helped Trump, and Trump was pleased with the help.  He could not prove actual cooperation and communication.

2020-06-24T23:09:17Z,socialgist,"It seems a bit disingenuous to call all of those cases voter fraud, at least in the sense we're talking about. From my perspective, voter fraud consists of the illegal casting of a vote, not the illegal counting, buying of votes, changing the vote count, etc.

From the looks of this website, it looks like the types of fraud that you would be worried about regarding ballot harvesting might be ""Fraudulent Use Of Absentee Ballots"" and ""Impersonation Fraud At The Polls.""

I quickly scanned through the ""Fraudulent Use of Absentee Ballots"", and it looks like there's on the order of 250 counts, each perhaps with a few actual votes changed (with the one exception I noted from North Carolina on the last page). I didn't want to spend an hour going through all of them, so if I missed any ""big"" ballot harvesting voter fraud charges, please let me know.

Next, for impersonation fraud at the polls, a cursory examination seems to indicate that these are events of a single person going and voting on behalf of a single other person, but again, I could have missed a few.

I'm still looking for evidence that ballot harvesting itself is a wide-spread issue. At most, we're talking ~1000 changed votes (regarding the fraudulent use of absentee ballots) since 2000 in a country that has cast over a billion votes since then. Is this really a problem worth legislating?

To point out some hypocrisy, the right seems to feel that only a few dozen unarmed black men have been killed by police, so perhaps it's not worth legislating to reduce this quantity. Why is that the case for police brutality, but not for ballot harvesting? For the record, I'm not accusing you of this particular claim, but you probably agree with me that a lot of people on the right (including many people in this sub) have made the argument regarding police brutality that it's effectively a non-issue.",wolfman29,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskTrumpSupporters/comments/hf6oaq/yesterday_trump_claimed_that_the_state_of/fvwit6g/,2020-06-24T23:09:17Z,"","",,,

2020-06-24T23:10:53Z,socialgist,"> No, they sell their song rights to music labels.

Er no. You confuse everything: copyright, performance rights, royalties...          
An artist may sell his song rights to anybody he wants, but signing a contract with a label is not a renouncing of rights. That's not how it works.


>  Trump campaign pays 

Says who? You have a source that he duly payed? That [wouldn't be like him](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/hundreds-claim-donald-trump-doesn-t-pay-his-bills-n589261).

> music label and gets to use song

The license comes from performing rights organizations who have themselves contracts with the labels and the artists as well as musical venues (that includes restaurants, cafe...).         
It's common practice that a venue can use any songs handled by the organization for a regular fee. It would be impossible to ask each and every artists before using their song.          
But the artist has every right to oppose the use of his song at any moment. Especially if he doesn't want to be associated to a politician. Even if his org made him sign a ""non-discriminatory"" clause, he has other legal grounds to oppose the use of his song. 

> It’s perfectly legal, otherwise the artists could sue.

They can, sometimes they [do](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_on_Empty_(song)#Later_uses) and they win. But you know just like me that a trial is a long and tenuous. Especially with a guy like Trump who knows about laws, has an history of not paying his bills and, just a detail, is the president.

No matter what the WH and its cronies want to achieve, they have to do so publicly. There are checks and balances in place to prevent absolute corruption. The house is Democrat controlled and is trying its best to hold Trump accountable. 

The actions of the president are reported by the media. The media tries its best to hold Trump accountable, mostly. There are cronies in the media, as well, but there are enough people trying to expose the truth that things are very hard to hide. This is how we know about the various illegal activities already done by Trump.

None of these things exist in private industry. Backroom deals, corporate takeovers, IP law abuse, etc. 

Private industry has very little oversight. Look at the ""self regulation"" that led to Boeing letting multiple planes full of people crash. Look at BP causing a massive oil spill at Deepwater Horizon. 

Private industry is not more efficient, it is not better run, and it is not cheaper. The GOP has been selling this lie for decades and gullible fools buy it.

However, under capitalism the reality was that the life of the majority of workers improved, so they didn't give a damn about the idea of a revolution.

So now marxists need to recruit once again new groups to achieve the revolution and they are currently doing so by highjacking other causes: BLM, LGBT+, feminism, etc.

The police killed in 2018 9 unarmed black persons and 19 unarmed white persons. 3600 blacks were killed by blacks last year. Were there any BLM protests over any of these 3600 murders? No.

2.  You know jack shit about foreign policy, if you think a president who loves russia knows anything about it.


Trump has been a useful idiot for Soviet/Russian Intel since at least 1987. 




July 4 1987: [Trump visits Moscow for the first time at the invitation of the Soviet Ambassador](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/11/19/trump-first-moscow-trip-215842)
At the time the Kremlin was cultivating Western businessmen and other public figures as opposed to more traditional intelligence sources. They focused on men susceptible to flattery and infidelity.


July 1987: [changes registration to Republican](https://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2015/aug/24/jeb-bush/bush-says-trump-was-democrat-longer-republican-las/)


Sept 2 1987: [runs $95k in full page newspaper ads criticizing ""American foreign defense policy,"" specifically mentioning Japan and the Persian Gulf.](https://apnews.com/05133dbe63ace98766527ec7d16ede08)

Sept 1987: [speaks publicly about running for President for the first time. The NY Times notes that this is sudden and he had never publicly expressed interest in politics previously.](https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/02/nyregion/trump-gives-a-vague-hint-of-candidacy.html)



The only consistency in Trump's politics over the decades is that he has ALWAYS shown unusual interest in geopolitical issues involving the USSR/Russia and ALWAYS promotes positions favorable to them. 

[Trump defends Soviet Union's 1979 invasion of Afghanistan](https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/03/politics/trump-cabinet-meeting-afghanistan-soviet-union/index.html) This one was very blatant.  He didn't get this Soviet talking point from Fox News or any American.

What do you think of the Trump admin's judicial record despite all of these appointments? The trend is fairly consistent regardless of Democratic or Republican judges presiding on the cases. The admin has lost about 90% of its deregulation efforts in federal court, with many judges ruling that they presented 'arbitrary and capricious' arguments that often failed to provide reasoned explanations, or that they failed to follow public notice-and-comment requirements (both basic federal court requirements outlined in the 73 year old Administrative Proceedures Act)

https://policyintegrity.org/trump-court-roundup

""It serves important administrative law values by promoting agency accountability to the public, instilling confidence that the reasons given are not simply convenient litigating positions, and facilitating orderly review.""

But even if we look at state polls, Biden is doing much better right now than Clinton was in the final RCP averages in 2016. He's ahead of Clinton in MI (8.0 vs 3.4), PA (5.6 vs 1.9), FL (6.2 vs -0.2), AZ (4.0 vs -4.0), OH (tie vs -3.5), and IA (-1.5 vs -3.0). Even if the state polls are as wrong this year as they were 4 years ago, Biden is comfortably ahead in enough states to win the electoral college. And a 1.2 percentage miss in the national polls still puts him up by over 8 points, which would be the biggest win since 1996. If the polls are wrong the other way (in Biden's favor), and he wins by over 11 points, it would be the biggest win since 1984, and there is an outside chance Biden wins over 400 electoral votes (he would be the first Democrat since LBJ to do that).",ltl1109,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/hf9bqo/if_trumps_polling_deficit_stays_the_same_or_grows/fvwj5mb/,2020-06-24T23:13:28Z,"","",,,

The president of the US is a retarded howler monkey during a time of a serious pandemic, one who refuses to think of it as anything but a plot to make him look bad. Thus, he has been egging on irresponsible behavior such as going out in public without a mask, and urging armed rebellion against state governments over lockdowns.

So as a result of all this, [virus cases are on the rise in the US.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/24/world/coronavirus-updates.html] What happens next is that governors are going to be forced to extend lockdowns, maybe even mandating them by law, which might be enough to push the armed MAGA-hatters to the point of shooting, and then armed riots break out everywhere. [Other countries start closing their borders to Americans.](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-53161447)

The US economy, already reeling from three years of Trump's demented bumblefuckery and now the added dick punch of the virus, collapses in a flaming heap, and that's when the fun begins for the rest of the world. The US economy is closely tied to many other economies around the world. US stock markets collapse, bankrupting foreign investors. US companies that provide products and services abroad collapse. While most integrated circuits are built overseas (mainly Asia), much of the equipment to do that comes from the US. Without parts and service, chip fabs begin to scale back and shut down, starving the world of ICs, which triggers more chaos. At some point, the Moron-in-Chief decides that he's going to hold China responsible for his mess, and attacks them, triggering a massive war that the US *might* eventually win, but only at STAGGERING cost (including the possible loss of most or all of the capital ships in the US surface Navy).

2020-06-24T23:13:41Z,socialgist,"> I just reread your initial response to see if you made an argument about how people should campaign. 

It's not about how they should campaign. It's about how they are campaigning. An entire paragraph in my first comment:

> So before we even factor in people like Joe Manchin who are already part of the caucus, we can't win a majority without winning in red/purple states. Every one of those candidates is running on a public option, not on M4A. The reason is that a public option polls better than M4A and leaves them less open to attacks. In a race where every vote matters, that is a simple choice for them.

I'm not sure how you're not seeing this stuff. It's pretty clear. We can't win a majority without winning in those states. They are campaigning right now on what they're willing to vote for. They are choosing those things based on what will get them elected in hard to win places. 

You ignored my point at the end of the last comment. Can you let me know when the last time a progressive has won* a Senate seat in a red state? If that's the clear answer, why is no one doing it?

>If you are going to lose your job anyways, might as well go big. Why get kicked out of office to pass a Heritage Foundation plan, national RomneyCare?

Ugh. Lazy ass talking point after lazy ass talking point. Can you show me where the Heritage Foundation proposed adding over ten million people to Medicaid? 

>Bernie and his policies did win major primary victories in Blue States, California being one of them.

We're...not talking about blue states. How hard is this? Go ahead, seek to elect progressives in California. That makes sense. Those progressives can't do shit without majorities. Majorities don't depend on winning in CA. They depend on winning in the hard to win red/purple states. Those people are the limiting factor for forming majorities and they're the limiting factor for what can be passed. I honestly don't know how to explain it more clearly.

> Under Moderate rule the party lost over 900 state legislative seats, 13 governorships, the senate, the supreme court, and the Presidency.

Under moderate party rule, they won those seats in the first place. Yes, they went through a bad spell with a lot of losses. They wouldn't have been able to do that if they didn't go through two consecutive wave elections where they won massive number of seats. 

> You decided to respond to that by, I guess, starting up a completely different thread of discussion on how moderate policies are the only viable campaign strategy.

I responded to something specific *you* wrote. I even quoted it for you. 

""These are the kind of paragraphs that are just frustrating and demoralizing. It is a weird nod to some ""common wisdom"" the pundit class have a monopoly on that, even in a hypothetical future where the Democrats control the Presidency and the Congress, M4A and GND are non-starters.""

I'm explaining to you why that's the case. We're talking about why majorities in Congress are not all it takes to pass sweeping change legislation. I'm not the one who's not reading. You've consistently been responding to some argument I'm not making. I still don't know how you could read my initial comment and think ""Oh, he doesn't know we're talking about a situation where Democrats have a majority.

Theoretically Joe Biden can win the electoral college but loose the popular vote.

By organizing a green party vote by alphabetical last name, Joe can just barely win safe states, and massively loose red states... 

Even better, we could get enough green votes to dump Biden

Consider that the electoral college is weak and possible to hack by a 3rd party! 

**The minimum percent of votes for Green Party POTUS win is roughly 17% of votes (1/3 of 1/2 = 1/6) to get 270.**

GP is already on the 2020 ballot for 20 states totaling 279 electoral votes. 

Electoral College Win Theory

**Theoretical minimum % of vote to win is equal to 1/2N, where N = number of candidates with similar level of popularity.**

N % votes of winner 

2 25% (50% of states voted 100% party #1, 50% of states voted 50.1% for winner) 

3 16.7% ...

But no country would dare allow him to come. He's been privy to so much classified information that anybody harboring him would spark WW3 before the wheels on his plane even touch the ground.

Other than that, I can see him trying to call his loyalists to surround the white house to protect him. He's already toed that line when the protests were getting bad with the whole ""I heard it's MAGA night at the White House"" bullshit.

Either way, if Trump gets trounced in November, which is more likely with every passing day, it's going to get ugly one way or the other. Trump is not going to leave the White House on good terms. I see no way that he makes it to a trial alive, because him testifying about what really went on while he was in charge is good for nobody, least of all America's image that he was ever even ALLOWED to go that far.

Oh golly do I have solid examples for why this is wrong.  Especially during ham season, the news has like no bearing on stocks.  Hertz filed for bankruptcy, stocks rallied 800%.  Today news broke of CarMax and AutoNation looking at the rental car industry, Hertz stocks rallied an ADDITIONAL 55%.  It's not just them though.

We all expect scandals to be clandestine. If actions are flagrant, how can they be scandalous? Yet, again and again, Trump has announced scandalous misconduct on TV, as when the president told NBC’s Lester Holt that of course he fired James Comey to shut down the Russia investigation, or boasted to a Tulsa rally crowd that he slowed coronavirus testing to reduce the number of confirmed coronavirus cases. The normal mind tends to think: People don’t casually confess to serious wrongdoing. Trump just casually confessed. So the thing he confessed must not be seriously wrong, or it must not have actually happened.

> The normal mind thinks that way because it cannot readily absorb the combination of recklessness, arrogance, and cluelessness at the core of the Trump presidency. But here we are, June 24, 2020, confronted with it again: sworn congressional testimony that, yes, the attorney general overruled career prosecutors to protect a person whose testimony might implicate the president—delivered on the same day as one of Trump’s appointees to the federal appellate bench delivered an opinion overruling a trial judge, allowing the Department of Justice to protect another Trump associate from his own previous guilty pleas on charges of lying to the FBI.

2020-06-24T23:16:58Z,socialgist,">An examination of the Heritage Foundation database for the period 2000-2020 shows that reported instances of such fraud per capita are actually higher in ""strict"" states than either ""no excuse"" states or complete ""vote by mail"" states.
For these types of fraud, within the 29 ""no-excuse"" absentee states, there was one reported fraud case for every 2.4 million persons. This compared favorably to one such case for every 1.6 million persons in ""vote by mail"" states, and even more favorably than the strict states, with one fraud case for every 740,000 persons. Although mail ballot fraud was by no means frequent in any of the states, it was actually more common in the states that took the stricter, more Trump-favored approach.


>Nor is it the case that there is no time to switch to mail balloting for the November election. About nine states have already done so this year, with more likely on the way. Ohio even switched to mail voting for its presidential primary in the past month, with only a few weeks' lead time.

2020-06-24T23:16:58Z,socialgist,"Afghanistan and Iraq were inherited. 

Libya was a failure, but it was motivated by wanting to prevent Gaddafi's forces from slaughtering his own citizens in Benghazi, it was begged for by those same citizens, and it was supported by the UN security council and our allies. It failed because of the power vacuum that was left behind, but it's easy to see why the U.S. couldn't stay to try to nation-build after Iraq and Afghanistan. Whether or not to intervene was a terrible choice, and not intervening would have killed hundreds of thousands.

Syria was justified.

Pakistan, and drone strikes more generally, are complicated. The percent of civilians killed is unacceptable, but [no](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Fatalities_in_Terrorist_Violence_in_Pakistan.png) [higher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casualties_of_the_Iraq_War) than the percent of civilian casualties in traditional wars. A drone strike on a hospital is unimaginably horrible. Shooting a school full of children is [unimaginably horrible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Peshawar_school_massacre). 

Yemen is shameful. Obama started it (and is responsible), and Trump is happy to perpetuate it (and is responsible).

The world has bad actors, and bad actors lead to difficult decisions where both inaction and action have costs. Trump usually chooses inaction, which is no guarantee to protect innocent people.

But the breaking point was his savior complex - he had a female friend who needed a place to stay, and that quickly evolved into her being his roommate. Then she needs his car to go to work. Then she gets pregnant out of wedlock, keeps the baby even though she quit her job and has no means, keeps living at my ex's place until the baby is born. My ex let's her stay because she ""has no where else to go"" And he can't bring himself to kick her out with a tiny baby.

""Disinfectants are chemical agents designed to inactivate or destroy microorganisms on inert surfaces.""

2020-06-24T23:17:57Z,socialgist,"> Why are there so many arguments made that it ""doesn't exist?""

Literally no one thinks that antifa *literally* ""doesn't exist"".

What people say is that it is not a concrete organization. It has no leaders, no structure, no rules, no membership, nothing. Maybe *you* don't think that it's organized nationally, but a lot of conservatives (including Trump, seemingly) believe that it is and refer to it as if it is.

Yes there are antifa groups. No one is denying this. There are groups of people who call themselves antifa and organize events and protests. However, these groups are entirely unrelated to each other. They just have similar-ish political opinions and operate in similar-ish ways.

If 500 different groups of similarly-minded people across the country held a weekly book club on Thursdays, read mostly the same books as the other groups, and called it ""Thursday Night Book Club"", it would not be accurate to say that all of these people are members of ""Thursday Night Book Club"". Even if theoretically a number of them were directly inspired to start their club by hearing of the existence of the others, that would still not amount to them being a defined organization.

The point of clarifying ad nauseum that antifa isn't ""**an** organization"" is to try to prevent against things like the proposed labeling of ""antifa"" as a terrorist organization. This move would not make any sense, as there is no real definition for what ""antifa"" is and so there's no way to prove that a person is or is not a part of it.",Akuuntus,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskALiberal/comments/hf3vi0/why_do_so_many_liberalsprogressives_argue_that/fvwjiqj/,2020-06-24T23:17:57Z,"","",,,

You have celebs such as jimmy kimmel that gets a job on a democratic view channel and bashes anyone on the repbulican side for racial stuff or how they treat women. And I sit here all the time I see like um the man show .  Now it comes out about his black face incident and they are trying to play it off. So many people defending him when he did nothing but rip apart people in the past for same thing .. my argument is. We have people watching main stream media and watching political people say things and people believe them while those people speaking are doing nothing but being total hypocrites to say things to gain support when infact they are no better than the ones they bash .

Where I think I differ with some of the messaging is meeting in the middle on discourse. I brought it up elsewhere, but my father is a staunch Trump supporter. I engage him in conversation every chance I get. And it is often taxing, even heartbreaking. But the occasional breakthrough where I get through to him and can shift his perspective in some way is often worth that struggle (And I'll admit on occasion I've found my own views challenged and grown as well). I have other family members who get angry or refuse to engage, and that only pushes him further away.

I know the dynamic of a community is different than of a family. But I believe there is so much *good* in this community, that having those individuals exposed to differing viewpoints and respectful conversation is the best way to create lasting change.

THIS WAS ON A FRIEND’S PAGE: An anguished question from a Trump supporter: ‘Why do liberals think Trump supporters are stupid?’


THE SERIOUS ANSWER: Here’s what the majority of anti-Trump voters honestly feel about Trump supporters en masse:


That when you saw a man who had owned a fraudulent University, intent on scamming poor people, you thought ""Fine."" (https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2018/04/10/trump-university-settlement-judge-finalized/502387002/)


That when you saw a man who had made it his business practice to stiff his creditors, you said, ""Okay."" (https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-hotel-paid-millions-in-fines-for-unpaid-work)


That when you heard him proudly brag about his own history of sexual abuse, you said, ""No problem."" (https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/list-trumps-accusers-allegations-sexual-misconduct/story?id=51956410)


That when he made up stories about seeing Muslim-Americans in the thousands cheering the destruction of the World Trade Center, you said, ""Not an issue."" (https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/11/22/donald-trumps-outrageous-claim-that-thousands-of-new-jersey-muslims-celebrated-the-911-attacks/)


That when you saw him brag that he could shoot a man on Fifth Avenue and you wouldn't care, you exclaimed, ""He sure knows me."" (https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/10/23/president-donald-trump-could-shoot-someone-without-prosecution/4073405002/)


That when you heard him relating a story of an elderly guest of his country club, an 80-year old man, who fell off a stage and hit his head, to Trump replied: “‘Oh my God, that’s disgusting,’ and I turned away. I couldn’t—you know, he was right in front of me, and I turned away. I didn’t want to touch him. He was bleeding all over the place. And I felt terrible, because it was a beautiful white marble floor, and now it had changed color. Became very red.” You said, ""That's cool!"" (https://www.gq.com/story/donald-trump-howard-stern-story)


That when you saw him mock the disabled, you thought it was the funniest thing you ever saw. (https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/donald-trump-criticized-after-he-appears-mock-reporter-serge-kovaleski-n470016)


That when you heard him brag that he doesn't read books, you said, ""Well, who has time?"" (https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/01/americas-first-post-text-president/549794/)


That when the Central Park Five were compensated as innocent men convicted of a crime they didn't commit, and he angrily said that they should still be in prison, you said, ""That makes sense."" (https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/06/19/what-trump-has-said-central-park-five/1501321001/)


That when you heard him tell his supporters to beat up protesters and that he would hire attorneys, you thought, ""Yes!"" (https://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-trump-campaign-protests-20160313-story.html)


That when you heard him tell one rally to confiscate a man's coat before throwing him out into the freezing cold, you said, ""What a great guy!"" (https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/donald-trump-orders-protesters-coat-is-confiscated-and-he-is-sent-into-the-cold-a6802756.html)


That you have watched the parade of neo-Nazis and white supremacists with whom he curries favor, while refusing to condemn outright Nazis, and you have said, ""Thumbs up!"" (https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/08/why-cant-trump-just-condemn-nazis/567320/)


That you hear him unable to talk to foreign dignitaries without insulting their countries and demanding that they praise his electoral win, you said, ""That's the way I want my President to be."" (https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-insult-foreign-countries-leaders_n_59dd2769e4b0b26332e76d57)


That you have watched him remove expertise from all layers of government in favor of people who make money off of eliminating protections in the industries they're supposed to be regulating and you have said, ""What a genius!"" (https://www.politico.com/agenda/story/2017/12/29/138-trump-policy-changes-2017-000603)


That you have heard him continue to profit from his businesses, in part by leveraging his position as President, to the point of overcharging the Secret Service for space in the properties he owns, and you have said, ""That's smart!"" (https://www.usnews.com/opinion/articles/2018-03-05/how-is-donald-trump-profiting-from-the-presidency-let-us-count-the-ways)


That you have heard him say that it was difficult to help Puerto Rico because it was in the middle of water and you have said, ""That makes sense."" (https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2017/09/26/the-very-big-ocean-between-here-and-puerto-rico-is-not-a-perfect-excuse-for-a-lack-of-aid/)


That you have seen him start fights with every country from Canada to New Zealand while praising Russia and quote, ""falling in love"" with the dictator of North Korea, and you have said, ""That's statesmanship!"" (https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/02/politics/donald-trump-dictators-kim-jong-un-vladimir-putin/index.html)


That Trump separated children from their families and put them in cages, managed to lose track of 1500 kids, has opened a tent city incarceration camp in the desert in Texas - he explains that they’re just “animals” - and you say, “Well, OK then.” (https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/more-5-400-children-split-border-according-new-count-n1071791)


That you have witnessed all the thousand and one other manifestations of corruption and low moral character and outright animalistic rudeness and contempt for you, the working American voter, and you still show up grinning and wearing your MAGA hats and threatening to beat up anybody who says otherwise. (https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/democracy/reports/2018/06/04/451570/confronting-cost-trumps-corruption-american-families/)



What you don't get, Trump supporters, is that our succumbing to frustration and shaking our heads, thinking of you as stupid, may very well be wrong and unhelpful, but it's also...hear me...charitable.



Because if you're NOT stupid, we must turn to other explanations, and most of them are less flattering.

- If the vote was unanimous I doubt it would change, it was his fault that it had gotten to that point.

- Masks are not federally required and they won’t stop the spread even if they were. Multiple medical professionals have said that it helps prevent it from spreading but cannot just magically halt its spread. Trump himself was actively discouraging the use of masks for a very long time.

- The reason it was going down was because almost everyone in the country was quarantined. The rates are rising because of things opening back up and safety protocols almost not existing, this was predicted weeks if not a month before George Floyd’s tragic murder. If it’s because of the protests and riots how can you explain areas that have had basically none and are still going up? During his rally he literally packed his supporters together behind him to make it seem like he had a larger crowd; this included literal children and infants. Turns out some of his staff got COVID, how surprising.

Trump ignored the virus then claimed it as a hoax for fucking months. He decided that he should take half assed action in the middle of the outbreak spreading to America. He was so slow to react that governors were literally quarantining before Trump even considered it to be more than a “democratic hoax”. Now that a second wave has come he is trying to slow down testing so that the second wave doesn’t make him look more foolish.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

When Shari Albers moved three decades ago into Powderhorn Park, a tree-lined Minneapolis neighborhood known as a haven to leftist activists and bohemian artists like herself, she went to work sprucing it up. She became a block club leader, organizing her mostly white neighbors to bring in playgrounds and help tackle longstanding issues with crime. On many nights, she banged on the car windows of men who had come to solicit prostitutes outside her door, she said. She kept meticulous notes when dozens of men would gather in a circle for gang meetings in the park across from her house. After each episode, she called the police. But times have changed. After the death of George Floyd at the hands of the police, Ms. Albers, who is white, and many of her progressive neighbors have vowed to avoid calling law enforcement into their community. Doing so, they believed, would add to the pain that black residents of Minneapolis were feeling and could put them in danger.

Already, that commitment is being challenged. Two weeks ago, dozens of multicolored tents appeared in the neighborhood park. They were brought by homeless people who were displaced during the unrest that gripped the city. The multiracial group of roughly 300 new residents seems to grow larger and more entrenched every day. They do laundry, listen to music and strategize about how to find permanent housing. Some are hampered by mental illness, addiction or both. Their presence has drawn heavy car traffic into the neighborhood, some from drug dealers. At least two residents have overdosed in the encampment and had to be taken away in ambulances.

The influx of outsiders has kept Ms. Albers awake at night. Though it is unlikely to happen, she has had visions of people from the tent camp forcing their way into her home. She imagines using a baseball bat to defend herself.

“I am afraid,” she said. “I know my neighbors are around, but I’m not feeling grounded in my city at all. Anything could happen.”

The video of Mr. Floyd’s death and the outcry over racial injustice that came after has awakened many white Americans to a reality that people of color have known their whole lives: The scores of police killings they have seen in the news in recent years were not one-off incidents, but part of a systemic problem of the dehumanization of black people by the police.

In the city where the movement began, residents are not surprised that it is being taken especially seriously in Powderhorn Park, just blocks from Mr. Floyd’s deadly encounter with the police. For decades, the community has been a refuge for scrappy working-class activists with far-left politics. The biggest day of the year, locals often boast, is the May Day parade celebrating laborers.

Though it is one of the most diverse neighborhoods in Minneapolis, with black residents making up about 17 percent of the population, white people make up the largest group. About a third of the population is Latino.

Since the camp appeared, the community has organized shifts for delivering warm meals, medical care and counseling to people living in the park. They persuaded officials to back off an eviction notice served shortly after the campers arrived.

But many in the neighborhood, who were already beleaguered from the financial stresses of the coronavirus, now say they are eager for the campers to move on to stable housing away from the park.

I’m not being judgmental,” said Carrie Nightshade, 44, who explained that she no longer felt comfortable letting her children, 12 and 9, play in the park by themselves. “It’s not personal. It’s just not safe.”

On Friday, she sat in a shared backyard with four other women who live in neighboring houses. The women, four of whom are white, had called a meeting to vent about the camp.

Angelina Roslik burst into tears, explaining that she had spent the past four years fleeing unstable housing conditions and was struggling more than she cared to admit with the chaos the camp had brought into the neighborhood. Linnea Borden said she had stopped walking her dog through the park because she was tired of being catcalled. “My emotions change every 30 seconds,” said Tria Houser, who is part Native American.

The women agreed to let any property damage, including to their own homes, go ignored and to request a block party permit from the city to limit car traffic. Rather than turn to law enforcement if they saw anyone in physical danger, they resolved to call the American Indian Movement — a national organization created in 1968 to address Native American grievances such as police brutality — which had been policing its own community locally for years.

But some people in the neighborhood have already found their best-laid plans to avoid calling the police harder to execute than they had imagined.

Last Thursday night, Joseph Menkevich found a black man wearing a hospital bracelet passed out in the elevator of his apartment building two blocks away from the park. Mr. Menkevich, who is white, quickly phoned a community activist but she did not pick up. He felt he had no choice but to call 911, so he did, but requested an ambulance only, not the police.

Ultimately, a white police officer arrived at the scene. The officer checked the situation out briefly and then returned to his squad car.",326695RS,https://www.reddit.com/r/moderatepolitics/comments/hfbqot/a_minneapolis_neighborhood_vowed_to_check_its/fvwjn6r/,2020-06-24T23:19:22Z,"","",,,

2020-06-24T23:20:01Z,socialgist,"Thank you for your response. Even though others don't see the relevance in your last paragraph, it is EXACTLY why I made this post. The loved ones I have that do deny the severity of this, do so because they listen to Fox and Trump. The customers that come into my store with 'infowars' shirts on that yell at me for asking them to follow lines on the floor are the ones whos minds I am hoping to change. That's why it's relevant. They're listening to the wrong people. People who's interest is in their money, not their health. 

I had to unfriend my own mother on Facebook because her Trump posts about covid being a hoax are literally ruining our relationship. Her defiance to wear a mask even though I personally sobbed on the phone to her about the loss of my friend and neighbor are killing me. If that isn't enough for someone to change their ways I don't know what is. I want to maintain these relationships with the people I care about but if I cant convince them to care about others I just can't continue to care about them. It's so disheartening to know this is how people are responding to this. 

Your story gives me hope though. Hope that this emotional time will bring us closer to people being critical of the people they get information from. And hope that even the most stubborn people, when presented with enough evidence, will eventually change their ways.",deloslabinc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spokane/comments/hf45z6/do_you_know_someone_with_covid/fvwjp7a/,2020-06-24T23:20:01Z,"","",,,
2020-06-24T23:20:01Z,socialgist,"So I understand you are just annoyed and venting, but I think you are really thinking of Gen Z in a bubble and not looking at the big picture. 

One big problem with this is, while less young people are hospitalized and die than those over 75+, they still do. At least one hospital in Texas has about 25% of its hospitalized population in their 20s. The possibilities of long term consequences from more severe and even mild forms of illness aren't something people in Gen Z should be unafraid of. Gen Z isn't immune to having underlying conditions, like autoimmune diseases and cancer, and how is it fair to those Zoomers who did nothing, but already deal with health issues, to have to stay inside indefinitely, putting them even further behind, as the rest of their peers continue to spread the disease and lengthening the time they have to isolate from everyone and everything. 

People in their 40s and 50s are also not Boomers, but Gen X, and don't have social security and medicare and still need to work. They are dying in concerning rates, even if not as high as those over 75. Gen X are also typically the parents of Gen Z, and many many of Gen Z still live with their parents and are dependent on them. Zoomers going out and about, ignoring lockdowns will then bring back the disease and could kill one or both their parents (might not happen in the majority of cases, but the rate is 1% for 40-49 and 4% for 50-59, not insignificant. It is ~4% and~ 8% for those with underlying conditions). Parents dying or spending a significant amount of time in the hospital (so probably high hospital bills) or ending up with life-long complications would be incredibly detrimental to Gen Z. 

Gen X, Boomers, and Millenials are also most teachers and professors. Education can't happen in person without them. And if teachers, especially college professors who tend to be older, start dying off that will also be incredibly detrimental to Gen Z. There is already a shortage of K-12 teachers in a lot of places, forcing them to work in person and possibly killing them off during a pandemic won't help that. Gen X is also 35% of the workforce. Not insignificant, and while I'm sure a lot of Gen Z (and millennials) would like their jobs, enough of Gen X dying could also having devastating effects on the workforce and economy. 

I get that you are mad and bitter and you certainly have all the right to feel that way. Us millennials have been feeling that for years, especially after 2008. Remember though, ~45% of votes 50+ still voted for Clinton, and they don't deserve to die just or have to stay isolated for ever just because the other 55% supported Trump. Gen Z doesn't live in a bubble and aiding in killing off or trying to keep the country going without anyone 60 and older, or heck 40 and older, is not the right way to fight back.",archaeob,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/h036q3/2020_umbrella_thread/fvwjp7g/,2020-06-24T23:20:01Z,"","",,,

2020-06-24T23:21:08Z,socialgist,"How the primaries function is not a statement of how good a leader someone is—that is 100% the point of this proposal: that the standard model selects for bad leaders.

If you doubt that, than how could you possibly explain *both* that Trump is the best that one side has to offer, and before Clinton and now Biden are the best of the other side?

Can you really seriously explain that? If you have the courage of your convictions, you’ll provide an answer. 

>	The fatal flaw of your plan, again, is that Yang is not interested

He doesn’t want Biden, or else he never would have run. He dropped out exactly when staying would hurt the country—because he’s the best candidate, having the humility to do what’s right. 

We need to capture such a candidate who has that humility—Donald Trump is the result of incentivizing the opposite. 

That is the explicit tactic of *drafting* people with this strategy. It’s a feature to draft those who don’t want it, not a bug. The strategy is explicitly to promote people with the good nature to not want it—and consequently such good character that will 100% compel him to accept the drafting if we succeed in demonstrating to him that we, enough of us, have his back.

Which suggests the question, why are you here? This is a subreddit that still describes itself in the sidebar as existing to make him the president in 2020. I have his back under this new opportunity. Do you not?

I consider myself similar to Nick actually, socially liberal and fiscally conservative. 

However the republican party only supports fiscal responsibility when they are not the ones spending. So unfortunately Nick argument doesn't sit with me there is no supporting a ""conservative"" person in politics because Trumps takeover of the party unfortunately means you agree with all his statements and policies. Those that have spoken up and taken a moral stand (Mitt Romney) have been shuned and pushed out of the mainstream conservative movement and are clearly not welcome. I'd love to see nick meet in the middle with someone who is a trump supporter, and not just someone who disagrees about business regulations.

What you're actively neglecting to include in your analysis of 2016 is Trump was a largely unknown entity politically. Not unless you were a political junkie, per say. Regular voters knew next to nothing about Trump other than the reality TV stardom and being a 'billionaire businessman'. You also, apparently, don't remember much of his campaign's messaging/agenda. It was economically populist in nature. Was it bullshit? Of course it was. But see above. People didn't know this and/or were willing to take the chance not knowing how awful he would be. Even never-Trump people admit they had no idea he would be *this* bad. Give it the proper context in 2016. You're trying to evaluate 2016 through the lens of 2020 by applying criteria/information that simply hadn't happened or wasn't known then. Hindsight is 2020.

**My** point is simply Hillary ran a shit campaign and despite all the foaming at the mouth people have done towards Bernie people, she should still have won if she had bothered to actually campaign in vital states she took for granted.

As far as “kong-flu” is involved I find it hard to see how it is racist or some kind of hate against another culture. It is referring to a form of Chinese martial arts, kung fu, and seeing as to how it makes no hurtful reference to skin color or anything in particular, I dont really agree that it is a racist remark.

5 states are going to stop testing at the end of June. It's not hard tosee the connection between that and Trumps comments The tests could keep being funded, which would be a net positive to the US.

2020-06-24T23:23:49Z,socialgist,"The law the ruling was about, was the ACA. They're upholding a provision of the ACA from 2010, that mandated that a list of common services have price listings:

""[e]ach hospital operating within the United States shall for each year establish (and update) and make public (in accordance with guidelines developed by the Secretary) a list of the hospital’s standard charges for items and services provided by the hospital, including for diagnosis-related groups established under section 1395ww(d)(4) of this title.""

In 2018, the change was that the CMS required hospitals to post their charge lists online.

In June, the president released an executive order directing the HHS to propose a regulation to requiring hospitals to publicly post standard charge information. Nearly word for word, the section of the ACA passed in 2010. 

CMS reccomended a list of charges that comprise ""standard charges"", on it's own.

So, in short, the president's office sent a memo telling the HHS to actually follow the law (you know, his job as the head of the executive branch). The very law, which lest I remind you, *Trump wanted to repeal*, he in fact promised to do so in 2016. The GOP attempted to do so through legislation and through the courts even without any replacement, thus completely removing the provision that we're talking about. I don't see the big deal here, in any other administration this is barely news at all, the executive order basically didn't add anything to the situation except to serve as a lowball ""mission accomplished"". Sure, I'm glad they didn't completely fuck it up like they have done with nearly every other department, but thats an incredibly low bar.


Biden's campaign promises were to continue to support the ACA, and to strengthen it greatly, as well as to provide a public option. Therefore, including the thing that he supposedly didn't support, while Trump wanted to cut back social services like Medicare and Medicaid and to repeal the ACA. Biden is also running on reducing costs by breaking monopolies and to prevent Healthcare providers from billing surprise fees and services, among with a bunch of other provisions. I have yet to see a cohesive, reasonable plan from the Republicans or from Trump, other than removing the ACA and replacing it with state-run medical care, which is a terrible idea.

2020-06-24T23:24:07Z,socialgist,"I think there is a detrimental political bifurcation in  this country and it’s stuck on a feedback loop. I think it started with Gingrich and Clinton because Clinton sounded like the GOP base. More than Democrats previous. And that wedge continues to grow, gain traction, show up at the polls, and then the Tea Party unseats lifers. And these Tea Partiers believed Obama was a foreign national. 

There’s sensible policy that is being missed. Instead it’s walls vs Sanctuary cities, where the middle could be an increase in low skill visas like the Bracero program. 

Leftists see Trump as a racist or racist sympathizer. He should address this. There could be fence sitters on the moderate side who just can’t stomach Trumps perceived racism. 

I don’t totally agree with Trumps wall, but I do believe the media has a stake in making him look bad, I think the visa system needs to be looked at, and better trade deals should happen. If he went about this reasonably without the xenophobia, Biden would really have no leg to stand on.

You do. You asked me what to gather from it. That's the answer to your question.

> It sounds to me like many people in this community are taking this as indirect implication that those “inactive” voters and lack of cleaning voter rolls is evidence of nefarious wrongdoing.

That's OK that you interpret it differently. That's your interpretation. Trump's interpretation is obviously different. 

Here's the quote again: 

“Now, the difference is they get everybody, even if they’re not registered — (laughter) — if they’re not citizens, if they’re here illegally. They get everybody. That’s one of the little difficulties. And, you know, you go through a whole nation and you see what’s going on, and they report “zero illegality.” Check out California sometime. (Laughter.) Check out — no, check out the deal that they signed with Judicial Watch. It was — I think Judicial Watch was like 1 million or 1.5 million people. They settled. They agreed that that many people either voted illegally, shouldn’t have been voting — a lot of things. They settled. And Judicial Watch said, “Look, we were so high. What difference did it make?

Now, that's just a random civilian. How many cops do you think feel similarly to how she does? That there are people that they need to be hurting... The last few months have shown it to be not an inconsequential number.

The other problem is the lack of accountability for when they do this. Have you seen the [bodycam footage (Video 3)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdOYCr3kQy4) from the cops in Atlanta on May 20th that tasered and dragged the two people out of the car? Two officers were fired for that. [At 6:20](https://youtu.be/FdOYCr3kQy4?t=380) one of the cops that only faced consequences due to current political pressure can clearly be heard lying to his fellow officers, ""Did you see the gun? Ya, he was pulling a gun."" 

They lie all the time and get away with it. If there was a gun, the cops wouldn't of been fired from excessive force. 

[Check out Video 1](https://www.cbs46.com/apd-body-cam-video-of-5-30-2020-incident-with-two-college-students-video-1/video_8ea63b40-f37b-5d75-8a39-4f2f67af4e88.html) where at 2:21 you can hear someone yelling ""He's got a gun! He's got a gun!""

2020-06-24T23:26:05Z,socialgist,"Here are two more sources for it.

""A year after being fired by former Trump national security adviser Michael Flynn, lawyers at Covington & Burling revealed Thursday that they recently uncovered emails and handwritten notes that were “inadvertently” left out of a trove of records turned over last summer to his new defense counsel.""

https://www.law.com/nationallawjournal/2020/04/09/covington-hands-over-more-files-to-mike-flynn-after-inadvertently-missing-them-earlier/?slreturn=20200524191739

""Counsel investigated Flynn for potential criminal charges that included 1) lying to the FBI about his conversation with the Russian ambassador while he was part of President Donald Trump’s national security transition team, and 2) making a false statement in his filings under the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) for work he had allegedly done for the government of Turkey prior to the Nov. 8, 2016, election. Covington and Burling, LLP, a prominent law firm, represented Flynn in the investigation and in plea negotiations. The firm also assisted him in preparing the allegedly false FARA filings.


The lawyer’s interest in defending his or her actions may conflict with the obligation to zealously defend the client. Furthermore, the attorney can be a key witness if the client is charged, which may also disqualify the lawyer from representing the client in the criminal case.


Thus, the Covington attorneys who helped Flynn prepare his filings could become the star defense witnesses if they said any mistake in the filings was their responsibility rather than Flynn’s. In that event, no conflict would arise between Flynn’s interest and Covington’s interest.
On the other hand, if Flynn provided incorrect information to Covington that was included in the FARA filings, a clear conflict emerges because Covington has an interest in absolving itself from any responsibility and placing the blame entirely on Flynn. If Flynn had deliberately provided false information to Covington, the Covington attorneys would become witnesses against Flynn, and no lawyer at the Covington firm could represent Flynn with respect to the FARA charge.""

2020-06-24T23:26:27Z,socialgist,"I'll go point-by-point, since you requested it, but then I'll offer my honest thoughts about the motivation about this type of post, which really bothers me.

Your requests for ""reasonable Democrats"" to do for you:

**Point 1: Condemn the undemocratic destruction of our nation's monuments including those of of Ulysses S. Grant, various abolitionists, random people like Miguel de Cervantes (who was actually a slave himself)**

* Let's talk a second about about the difference between a statue and a history book. A statue is placed prominently as an act of reverence or honor, and by no means is the only way of preserving history. Take the still-standing concentration camps in Germany, for instance. They are there so that those atrocities will not be forgotten. But there are no statues of Hitler and Nazi Party leaders. Now, does Grant belong in that categorization? Probably not, and I think there definitely are fair examples of mob mindset leading to people getting carried away and losing nuance. So sure, *I'm wagging my finger at those who took down Grant.* But am I outraged? No--especially since the vast majority of statues being taken down were built as part of the ""Lost Cause"" movement that *intentionally tried to rewrite the history of the Confederacy* (also working through textbook censoring/editing). The statues were a tool of disinformation and I'm not batting a tear to see them torn down.

**Point 2: Defend the legacy of our founders**

* No, thank you. I would rather have a clear eye towards history than a nostalgic selective memory. Without question, there is a brilliance in the idealism of their words and a courage to create a foundation for what eventually was in terms of our country. But there also was a widespread refusal to acknowledge the humanity of people due to the color of their skin, to not only objectify but abuse and malign and torture. That is also part of their legacy. James Baldwin was right in reminding us that our history is our present and our failure to see that history in ourselves is a tragedy. I have no problem defending the legacy of our founding ideals. The founders, though? I don't tend to participate in idol worship--they were fallible and it is important to acknowledge those fallibilities. 

**Point 3: Call for an end to lawless behavior in places like the CHOP which just had its 3rd shooting in as many days and in Washington, D.C. where so-called protesters are trying to set up their own CHOP east**

* Are the CHOP-type protests idiotic, unsustainable offshoots that deserve criticism? Sure, not a hill I want to die on. But the coverage of this has far, *far* outpaced its actual influence, especially compared to the vast majority of the Black Lives Matter movement and the peaceful protests that have spawned internationally (for crying out loud, my own rural Arkansas town had a well-attended rally with the white mayor and police chief giving supportive speeches!). So am I going to focus my attention on the extreme outliers like conservative media is doing their darnedest to draw attention to? Again, no thanks. 

**Point 4: Unequivocally condemn violence in the streets**

* A bit of a straw man here, since I have yet to see a single person *praising* violence on the streets. But there is also a clear pattern of the violence of protesters *following* the escalation tactics by an over-militarized law enforcement--who also have not only failed to condemn abuses within their ranks *but have rallied in support of those abusers.* 

**Point 5: Stand up for the vast majority of our nation's police who are good and honorable people that put their lives on the line to defend their communities, even if they happen to exist in an otherwise flawed system.**

* See previous point. Being a neutral actor in a harmful system of oppression is to contribute to that system. Do I think they are inherently *bad people*? No, of course not. But I also don't think they deserve a blind pedestal (same with teachers, etc.)--especially if they are not willing to call out the bad actions not only of their colleagues but of their institution. 

**Final thoughts**: You can vote however you want. I will agree with one of the commenters that all of this reads like a justification for a choice you've already made. But that's not my main final thought. 

The fact that you are *outraged* by all of this, enough to write a post with this overt of a tone, is quite revealing of where you actually stand--compared to being outraged that people of color within our nation have a vastly different experience with law enforcement in the year 2020, having to fear daily abuse and even death because of the color of their skin. And if you don't see this, you just aren't looking. 

And if you *are* looking and aren't outraged? Well, that's about as revealing as it gets.

2020-06-24T23:26:33Z,socialgist,"I don’t think they have much they can do without taking up arms before the election because of how the House handled impeachment*. See, the thing is, to impeach a sitting president you have to give the party that controls the Senate a reason to impeach. That reason is never going to be about whether the action was right or wrong, rather, the reason is that their voters would turn on them had they not because of publicly available information (I’m sorry, but that’s politics in nutshell). I don’t know if this was possible with the Ukraine scandal, or really anything that’s happened, but I do believe that they rushed this and that he had done *many* more things that were impeachable. Had they both pursued those other offenses and sought more evidence than they had, there is a chance he could have been impeached and removed from office—especially given that we ended up as an epicenter of a pandemic, as it would most likely still be going on if the other impeachments in history are used as a measure. The House wanted this over before the primaries began for optics (coincidently, the senate literally voted not to convict the day before the first caucus). Could you imagine the optics for the GOP now were Trump still raving mad on Twitter about an ongoing “unfair” impeachment for several different offenses, not just Ukraine, and with 120,000 dead Americans, high unemployment, and mass protests? Trump’s approval was much higher when he was impeached, but today, the Senate might have had a few members in the tight races they’re in now, and those members may have wanted to save face to get re-elected. That’s unfortunately all any of this is about. I know that sounds defeatist, but it’s true. We saw it on both sides with regard to impeachment. The Dems had to impeach over Ukraine or risk upsetting voters (I do also believe his actions were wrong there), and the GOP sided with Trump for fear of losing theirs because of his popularity with their voters (at the time of impeachment).

Unfortunately, all that is left to do is vote. If that doesn’t work, all bets are off

Let’s break down why this doesn’t hold up:

What you’ve done is created a false analogy. The statements are in no way analogous for several reasons

- my original statement broke the population into two groups, trump supporters and everybody else. Everybody else would include democrats yes, but it also includes independents and some republicans. Lately there have been several prominent Republican figures/groups that have been actively speaking out/campaigning against Trump.
- your statement adds the implication that all republicans are trump supporters and all people against trump are democrats which as I’ve demonstrated in the previous section is not true. Some example republicans against Trump: the Lincoln Project, https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/23/politics/steve-schmidt-donald-trump/index.html (yes I know the source is CNN and you can’t fathom anything they say is truth because you refuse to even read it but the bulk of this article is giving context on who the quote is from and then his quote so don’t even try the biased argument), etc.

The goal isn't an excited voter base so much as a less motivated opposition.

A focus on President Trump in 2016 didn't work as well because 2016 couldn't be a referendum on someone who wasn't even in office yet.

In 2020, the election is a referendum on President Trump.

Republicans also have worked decades on dragging Clinton through the mud.  She was more vulnerable in US politics to that because she is a woman; in US politics, women perceived as ambitious are received poorly.  

President Trump could genuinely scare a lot of older people, who grew up in the Cold War, by painting Senator Sanders as a communist. Our country isn't immune to McCarthyism.

Senator Sanders couldn't motivate enough of a base to win a plurality of left-wing voters.

The fact is this should worry you people. If you ever elect a Bernie like figure they could do the same to him. The one reason they want to get rid of Trump is tariffs and the fact he's not completely on board with free trade, which is a threat to corporate profits. The other stuff is just a distraction, his tweeting and muh Russia/Ukraine don't make a material difference to anyone. Imagine what they'd do to a class based leftist.

2020-06-24T23:28:28Z,socialgist,"Let's begin with saying I have been listening to Kinda Funny for about 2 years straight and pretty much love all the game content. Mostly listen to KFGD and gamescast (especially Andreas episodes). I have never really gotten involved in the community not have I attended anything (almost an Austin meet up but couldn't make it). I absolutely love the crew and most of the content that is put out. With all that being said, the last few days I have been extremely turned off by the conversation happening. 

I listened to the ""TOWN HALL"" and where I agreed with some of the points, I really felt isolated and and felt as if I were asked to stop listening to the content. I am 35 from Houston Texas and abig Xbox fan. Below are the main issues that bothered me. 

1) I did vote for Trump in 2016 for my own reasons. Saying that publicly will have me being harassed and I usually avoid telling people. But after listening to the town hall cast I felt as if I was not wanted in the community for doing so. I do not think Trump is a good person, I do not think he's the best president but I also don't think he's been the worst president in the history of this country. I do not agree with much of what he says, especially on twitter. He's not a politician and has never been socially inept. I agree with him on mostly economic and trade issues and some other things here and there. The fact that has me being isolated is that voting or supporting Trump really did come off as a blacklist statement for this community. There are other people's opinions and views on this world than the one that is being presented here. I do not watch or listen to the content because they align with my political views. I could care less if they did or not. I tune in because they are good people that have a good time and like to laugh. I am no way a racists, sexist or what ever ""ist"" you want to put out, but I just don't align with some of y'all's views and that's ok... Or at least I thought it was. 

2)Toward the end of the podcast there was talk about Cool Greg's twitter (I didn't see the post and don't actually follow him) but what really bothered me was that it came off as the group trying to mold and change Greg away from his ideals and beliefs. Again, I may be wrong here, but the idea that someone is ""broken"" or ""doesn't know better"" comes off as that they do not agree with you or see things your way so it's their responsibility to mold him into what we believe is the right way. This really bothered me and seemed manipulative. Maybe I'm stretching on this one but it really rubbed me the wrong way. 

3) Even though they talked about being ok with conservatives it came across as saying that to save face. Again, I could give two shots about what people believe politically as long as they are nice to me and my close group of people around me, their ideals and beliefs do not matter. I don't feel this reciprocated here and it's a bummer. Income for the games and laughs, not to be woke or challenged on my ideals. 

Again, I am a silent member of this community and have loved listening to everything. I do not come here to have my ideals changed, I come here to Get away from it all, but it is starting to feel like that is not ok. In no way do I want this place to also become politicized (sp). I am willing to have any conversation with anyone, as long as it's civil, about my ideals and beliefs. I do not expect to change anyone's opinion and do not want someone to change mine. I think during this time the most important thing is to have a conversation with someone you do not agree with you truly understand why they feel the way they do. That is something I feel the guys hit on the head, I just really hope they do have those conversations and are truly open to having that type experience.

EDIT: I DO NOT LIKE THE MAN. AT ALL. I can't stand Trump but my biggest argument is that there is a bigger issue here than the president. Our society has major issues that goes beyond the president and it has been going on before Trump. My only thing is that it's not about who you vote for. Unfortunately that's what this world has come to. Judgement is rampid rather than the character of the person. You can judge my character all you want by one aspect of my life, but you would be wrong. Very wrong.

And none of those numbers exist today, or in a future moment where President Trump holds a rally in NYC which he wouldn't do anyway. Has he EVER held a rally in NYC?

You're asking me to mash up unrealities and comment on them using principles. But I cannot do that because it's too difficult to apply the calculus of principles on such an unreality.

>>He didn't though. So why hypothesize about if he had?

>Again, I am not hypothesizing if he had. I am asking if it would have been a good idea to gather people in large numbers under those circumstances. Once again, NOT asking what your feelings would be in the hypothetical case someone did so.

Too many unknowns. Where? When? Under what rules?

>>Maneuvering explanations on a totally made up hypothetical with so many unknowns is too difficult and unhelpful. Then deriving some principles off a hypothetical to other hypotheticals ... it's just too shakey.

>What are the unknowns that make this question too shaky and a totally made up hypothetical to other hypotheticals?

Everything. When, where, under what rules, what circumstances, what hangs in the balance, why, are there alternatives, how would it be run, who would be there, and so on.

>If you prefer I can ask about a real rally that just happened. President Trump held one in Phoenix, AZ recently.

The TPA one? That was like 99% people below 22 years old probably. Almost 0% of chance of problems for them. 

I can't believe after a month of Democrat mass protesting, where health professionals, Democrat pooiticians, Democrat youths, voters, corporations, tv shows, etc. ... did a total 180⁰, ... we're now gonna return to try again at shaming Trump supporters for gatherings. 

That attack line is dead. That ship has sailed.

There are currently 870 Article 3 federal judgeships. Trump has appointed and the Senate has confirmed 200 of them, with 44 nominations awaiting confirmation, and 75 vacancies. They serve for life. Thus there is the potential for Trump to have overhauled 37% of the entire federal court system for the next generation in his first term alone.

This is the only way to win the AWB argument without a war. Someday the issue will be resolved judicially one way or the other, and I’d rather have Republican appointed and confirmed judges hearing the case than otherwise, even recognizing that it’s not a guarantee of a win.

No they can’t. They can’t count their votes.

>	One of my people came up to me and said, ‘Mr. President, they tried to beat you on Russia, Russia, Russia. That didn’t work out too well. They couldn’t do it. They tried the impeachment hoax. That was on a perfect conversation. They tried anything, they tried it over and over, they’ve been doing it since you got in. It’s all turning, they lost, it’s all turning. Think of it. Think of it.

2020-06-24T23:29:45Z,socialgist,"Biden seems to be benefiting so far from the fact that there's no real 3rd party candidates this time around. That seems to be making it quite a bit easier so far to get the 50.1%+ he needs to win where he needs to in a winner take all system. At the very least, the momentum from being consistently over 50% in the national polls is something that is not often seen in recent elections and I'm sure can only help with his campaign's image. 

 It seemed back in 2016 that the polls that gave Clinton the best advantage over Trump left out Johnson and Stein which made them pretty misleading. That 4-5% that made it nearly impossible for one candidate to reach a majority (and which seemed to hurt Clinton more than anything) made it a lot easier for Trump to get away with winning a number of swing states with a plurality and getting the electoral votes he needed to win the election while in 2nd place. 

Not having those popular 3rd party candidates in this race this time around just makes it a lot easier for someone to win outright with a majority as we saw in 2008 and 2012 (and we know it would be practically impossible for Trump to secure a majority of the popular vote no matter what he does).",williamfbuckwheat,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/hf9bqo/if_trumps_polling_deficit_stays_the_same_or_grows/fvwkkvj/,2020-06-24T23:29:45Z,"","",,,

Why do Trump supporters let him get away with clear lies and abuses of power? Same reason you let Barack and Biden and Hillary etc etc etc.  That's whataboutism.  When you say ""we can do X despit X being bad because they did X too""

They’re around up north which is baffling because... you won, why fly loser flags?

My mom has a lot of anti Trump stickers on her car and some genius stuck a confederate flag on it in PA.  Over her N.C. license plate which was a confederate state.

Didn’t even see as many as won would expect in SC despite them... starting it.  The local government just pulled down a statue of Calhoun, which, I passed that statue many times lol.  I’m hoping they start putting up pop culture icons that lasted longer than the confederacy.

Unfortunately there are always those that will choose reactionary views like white nationalism, fascism, etc. Trump may have fanned those flames, but he didn’t start the fire.

2020-06-24T23:33:21Z,socialgist,"> Why even do porn if there's no money in it? I'm a big ole prude, so I cannot fathom doing it even for money. But what is the point if that's not even there?

There's basically been three ""eras"" of porn:

* During the ""Golden Age of Porn,"" it was mostly men filming hippies and drug addicts and then the movies were shown in porn theaters. This era was from about 1965 until 1980. Nobody was getting rich, it was basically a bunch of freaks making movies. ""Boogie Nights"" covers this era just about perfectly; it's ridiculously accurate, and the characters in the movie are based on real people. For instance, ""Dirk Diggler"" is based on ""John Holmes.""

* The next era was from 1980 to 1995. This is the era when porn companies were making money hand-over-fist. It was *incredibly* profitable because VCRs and DVD players allowed people to buy porn and watch it at home. They no longer had to go watch it in an adult movie theater. This created *enormous* revenue streams. The second era came crashing down **hard** because of the Internet. Women in the porn business went from making $100-$200K a year to nearly nothing, in a matter of a couple years.

* Right now we're in the third era. In this era, porn is largely a way for prostitutes to raise their prices. IE, if you're a prostitute in Dayton Ohio, you'll be lucky if you can charge $300 an hour, and you'll probably have about 5-10 customers a week. That's around $100K a year. But if you do a few porn movies, you can charge $1000 an hour and you'll have 5X as many customers. Due to this, prostitutes use porn as a way to raise their income from $100K a year to $400K a year. Stormy Daniels is a great example of this; she was 27 when she hooked up with Donald Trump, and if she wasn't a porn star she wouldn't have been able to charge so much for sex.",PortlandSolar,https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/hek1er/adult_film_star_ron_jeremy_charged_with_three/fvwkwo7/,2020-06-24T23:33:21Z,"","",,,

Allerdings hat die GOP weniger Anhänger als die Demokraten, und bei den Unabhängigen hat Biden jetzt 21 Prozentpunkte Vorsprung.

>Ob das aber wirklich an Biden persönlich liegt oder nur an der Tatsache, dass er Trumps Gegner ist?

Anders als Clinton ist Biden ein ""Menschenfänger"" - man vergleicht nur mal die warmen Worte, die Sanders für ihn hat, mit dessen zähneknirschender Unterstützung für seine Rivalin vor vier Jahren.

>Allerdings mahne und warne ich davor, den Kerl wieder zu unterschätzen.

Da kann ich mich nur anschließen, aber von irgendeiner Überheblichkeit ist bislang bei Trumps Gegnern wenig zu spüren. Der Grundton ist eher der hier:

>Anybody out there right now thinking that Joe Biden has this thing in the bag needs their fucking head examined.

May I remind you that the only evidence they have is

* the testimony of [REDACTED] (widely assumed to be Joe Pientka, and scarce enough around DC that he might even have been ""disappeared"")
* the testimony of Lisa Page (who was not present, so can only be a liability to the prosecution)

And that's it. Not video tapes, no audio recordings, nothing. 

All of these have major problems for the prosecution, so could you please explain ""deluge of evidence"" to me?

But nobody cares about the queen. She's boring. When Trump visits a country it's a spectacle. I'm not saying she has zero coverage in China. But, you can't honestly tell me she has more than Trump. Trump is in a trade war with China. It's just so much more impactful when Trump is in the news. People talk about him. They don't talk about the queen. This means he gets more exposure. People see the news, then they talk about it to their friends. They see the queen on the news, and they don't care. So it stops there. Trump gets far more exposure, especially in China, which is the most important factor here tipping the scales in favor of Trump.


>Why do you think those under 15 don't know of the Queen? 

They didn't grow up knowing about her. The queen is boring. It's something you learn about in history class. Some of them know, but many don't. Even if they've learned of her in class, you ask them, and they don't know who she is. But ask them who Trump is? Way more will know.

Of all the things you stated - wearing masks is the only thing each person can do EVERY time they have to be in public. Like you said, it’s impossible to keep everyone housebound, but if you can’t see how wearing a a face mask is the most minimal common denominator to help reduce the spread, then you seriously need to educate yourself on respiratory diseases. 

Here’s another analogy. No individual was likely to prove in court that another person’s secondhand smoke caused their cancer. Nonetheless, it was recognized as a public health issue. Most states went on to ban smoking in public buildings and restaurants. As stupid as it was, a small minority of smokers said that was the government infringing on their rights. The vast majority of people likely don’t look back at those individuals and think “they were fighting the good fight.” Why not? Because science, public health, commercial enterprises, and policy makers determined that minority’s rights infringed on the collective public health of everyone around them.

So I don’t really think anyone holds people accountable at this point for their 2016 vote. 

But 4 years later, we know exactly who he is and what he is like. He’s a vile human being. He’s a terrible husband and father. He’s a terrible leader. He actively divides and pits his citizens against each other. He is a disgusting irredeemable person. 

In 2020, if his behavior over the last 4 years isn’t a deal breaker, that says a lot about a person. I also am fiscally conservative, but I’m a wealthy white man. If prioritizing my money and financials is more important than standing up against straight up barbaric behavior, that would be a failure on my part.

2020-06-24T23:35:07Z,socialgist,"She considers herself catholic because she was raised that way, but the Catholic Church is evil.

The queen of England is evil. the CURRENT QUEEN OF ENGLAND was responsible for colonization and slaughtering people.

She is superior to my parents and our family because she dropped out of high school and education is bullshit.

She is superior because she had to make her own way in the world and get a job at 18, her parents having kicked her out (lies, her parents helped her out financially numerous times, and she didn't go to college cause she ran off and got married against her parents' advice).

She is superior because she doesn't watch the news or television or any of that nonsense, but yet still knows about all of it and watched Trump's inauguration and was surprised I didn't.

She watches TV ""when she wants to"" as opposed to all us mortals who watch it because we're brainwashed.

She will never get vaccines or accept benefits from the government, except when she does

School only teaches memorization and not common sense, she knows better than anyone with a university degree. I am studying for a Master's in education and so I am part of the evil soul-sucking system to make everyone conform (even though I personally hold beliefs in progressive forms of education that promote individual strengths and am learning things in my classes that support this)

Doctors are all hacks. Some guy she follows on Youtube knows more about Coronavirus than my sister who is a doctor.

Coronavirus is a conspiracy. Which specific theory she believes changes from day to day, I'm not sure if she thinks it is a real virus created in a lab or a complete lie.

Blood donations, transplants, transition surgery, and in-vitro fertilization are wrong because they aren't ""of God"". Even though she and her family members have been saved by blood transfusions.

Medical care is all evil and corrupt and mostly lies, even though it has saved her life, her husband's life, and her parents' lives numerous times (her parents are dead now, but they would have died when she was a young child if not for medical care). Did I mention my sister is a doctor?

The government is taking away our freedoms using the Coronavirus hoax and we should all stop ""living in fear"" of it.

Her friend, in a province with only 7 recorded deaths from Covid-19. hasn't had to cremate any bodies as a result of Covid-19, therefore it's a hoax and nobody is dying.

the laws of the Catholic Church are the laws of our country and attempting suicide is a criminal offence, doesn't believe me when I tell her I have literally attempted suicide and been brought to hospital by police and haven't been charged with a crime. (I am doing fine now, this year has actually been better for me mental-health-wise than previous ones)

My family and I are all brainwashed by the mainstream media and our education

gay and transgender are interchangeable terms to her but of called out on it she will insist she knows the difference

she is all for LGBT rights, but simultaneously believes all sorts of transphobic and homophobic things and that she ""doesn't need to approve of gay relationships"". She also adamantly REFUSES to call my transgender friend by her preferred pronouns.

She shall not bow down to the conformity and brainwashing the rest of us poor souls do

Edit: I almost forgot to mention, on top of medical care being a mountain of lies, vaccines being bad, and Coronavirus being a conspiracy, the Mandela Effect is proof of alternate realities, the moon landing was a hoax, 9/11 was an inside job, the illuminati knows the outcome of every election ahead of time, but somehow she isn't a conspiracy theorist.

2020-06-24T23:35:12Z,socialgist,"So in conclusion:

- Trump joked about a global pandemic to the American people, repeatedly, and put their health at risk, to the point of confusion.

- Trump has failed in general to deal with this pandemic or to act like a leader at any point during the crisis

- Trump attempted to cover up information repeatedly during the pandemic to make himself look better

- Trump is taking the first opporunity to declare victory and wind down the fight against the virus, despite his officials trying to work in spite of what he is saying (they havent spoken to him in weeks) - it reminds me of people disobeying his orders about Russia and hoping he'd just forget, like in the Mueller report.

- Trump is putting peoples health at risk with his rallies. He does nothing to encourage safety at his rallies and some of his supporters will definitely get sick. 

- Trump has shown glee before in his ""enemies"" getting sick (see Mitt Romney)

Basically, Trump hates US citizens and wants them to suffer. Or he's so stupid he is a failed leader causing US citizens to be confused and suffer during a crisis. 

That's basically your ""defense"" of him, even if he was joking. 

And you're going to have to find a NEW one when in a few weeks he DOES demand testing slows down.

> This conduct in particular is cause for great concern about what Barr will do next. In closing it needs to be said that Bill Barr does regularly lie in ways that impact official action. Along with his continuing media project to make Americans believe that the FBI conspired against Donald Trump, his statements about the Mueller report, Geoff Berman's supposed resignation, and Barr's own role in the events at Lafayette Park come quickly to mind. So does his practice of regularly shrouding himself in the rhetoric and trappings of the rule of law, even as he desecrates and undermines the institutions that make it possible.

[Gallup](https://news.gallup.com/poll/203198/presidential-approval-ratings-donald-trump.aspx) has Trump in the high-80's/low-90's.  Trump's tweets typically reference Rasmussen, which tends to lean slightly more conservative than most polls.  You can't access their demographic breakdowns without a paid membership, but I would expect them to be a couple points higher than Gallup.

Also your quoted text says 57-65% ""strong approval"", with presumably some other amount ""somewhat approval"".  I suspect that the sum is closer to the Gallup numbers.

For historical perspective, Nixon was forced out of office when his [approval among Republicans was around 50%](https://medium.com/@PollsAndVotes/nixon-watergate-and-partisan-opinion-524c4314d530).  Politicians are loyal to their reelection, not their president.  The most accurate polling out there will be that done privately by the political parties.

Overall I wanted to say that there does need to be much more accountability but unfortunately those sorts of private companies are the only ones with proper resources and programs already in place to meet the demand for testing. The need for mass production/scaleability is not possible for educational institutions to replicate.

Another thing i may add is with government funds many private pharma are scaling up production of possible covid treatments without properly testing to see if they work first. So we may see a large waste of our money due to this if those treatments turn out to be bad but the time save it takes to scale up production in the case that it does work is seen as worth it.",bunn2,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/hf00mr/as_25_states_show_more_covid19_cases_trump/fvwl99m/,2020-06-24T23:37:07Z,"","",,,

As head of the Judicial Committee, he tanked the Bork nomination, causing a seat that would have been held by a Kavanaugh-esque hack to instead be held by Swing Justice Kennedy, which directly lead to significant expansion of gay rights.  He also fast tracked David Souter through the nomination process when he learned Souter was significantly more liberal than Republicans thought, getting a liberal Justice named to the supreme court during a Republican administration.

And it’s like, trump has made the past four years miserable, but i absolutely hate everything biden (and voting for him) stands for. i kind of want to vote 3rd party to show that it’s not that i’m lazy/don’t want to vote, but that the main 2 options are that bad... like, maybe if we have a high turnout for 3rd party they’ll see that we’re not just going to cave and vote for whatever dogshit they throw us. plus, if they wanted biden so bad, then they can elect them on their own- good luck liberals. 

i’m honestly almost rooting for trump to win- given how strong tensions have risen the past 4 years to the point of protests now, maybe allowing the tensions to rise will finally spark the revolution we need. and it will also signify just how much the democrats need to listen to us- they are nothing without us. 

that said, i can’t deny the thought of trump winning hurts- i’ve lost my healthcare, protections for trans people like me have been rolled back, and i know myself and many others have gotten to the point of feeling suicidal over it all... so i understand those that want to still vote biden out of fears like these.

Midnight approaches. You've got your glass of champaign in hand, Auld Lange Syne cued up on your Bluetooth speakers, and a view of Times Square beaming into your cozy but sparsely attended party. A tense quiet falls over the conversation as everyone realizes what time it is. The ball begins its descent. The countdown begins.

Nine

You shout the words louder each time.

Eight

Seven

Holding your girlfriend tight by the waist you feel a jolt of exhilaration.

Six

Five

A new year about to begin, a new beginning, and hopefully an end to the nightmare of 2020 lie ahead.

Four

Three 

You raise your glass. You notice your palms are sweaty from the anticipation and you reflect on how ridiculous it may seem, to attach so much significance to the artificial boundaries we call months and years. That mark of progress itself may be artifical, you think, but the sentiment behind the occasion is real, and good, and important.

I wasn't necessarily talking about Bernie or Bust voters, just that uber Bernie fans are convinced that Biden will lose no matter what because they believed that only Bernie could beat Trump.

2020-06-24T23:37:40Z,socialgist,"We really need a temporary pinned thread that explains why this is not a good idea and why it won’t happen. 

First, in case you forgot, Yang already competed in (and lost) the Democratic primary. Why is this relevant? Because sore loser laws are designed specifically to prevent something like this from happening. The vast majority of states have laws which will prevent Yang from appearing on the ballot, meaning he would have to run a write-in campaign. Not only are write-in campaigns significantly harder to win because it requires people to actually know you are running, but it also provides an easy advantage to the opponents who can just say you dropped out and there is no reliable way to disprove that. In addition to this, several states have laws which would actually throw out any votes Yang got because he lost the primary. So not only would he have to compete in a heavily disadvantaged position, but he would have to majorly over perform. 

Second, not only does he have to over perform just to get a plurality against Trump and Biden, but he would have to do so to such an extent that he would actually win a majority of the electoral votes. If no candidate wins a majority of electoral votes, the House chooses the president and the Senate chooses the Vice President. That means we get Biden for president and Pence for VP, and if you thought things were already immensely divided, you do not want to see what happens when the only thing that keeps one party from the presidency is impeachment. There is a very good reason we moved from the person with the second most votes becoming Vice President.

So not only would Yang have to have a nationwide write-in campaign, but would have to do so and manage to win a majority of electoral votes when he can’t even compete in several states. On top of all of these problems, doing this after making a promise to back the nominee would completely destroy any chance at a political career because he would be seen as a liar and a cheat. So, you are not only asking that he perform an immensely difficult and implausible task, but that he also completely destroy his reputation, just so you can justify not voting for either Biden or Trump. 

If any of you value Yang in any way or value his ideas, you will put this thought of him making an independent run out of your mind. You will put the thought of him winning in 2020 at all out of your mind. The only possible chance he has would be if pretty much the entire Democratic field of candidates just drop dead and Hillary, Cuomo, and pretty much any other possible pick just decided to say no when offered the nomination and instead said, “I think that Yang guy should be picked instead.” However, given that Yang is by far an anti-establishment person, he would not be picked. 

People, please stop bringing this up as a serious topic. You are only giving people false hope by doing so, and it is a cruel thing to do to people. Give hope for 2024, but don’t play these foolish games of thinking anything will happen in 2020.",fryamtheiman,https://www.reddit.com/r/YangForPresidentHQ/comments/hf9070/dont_sleep_on_the_darkhorseduo_strategy/fvwlb6i/,2020-06-24T23:37:40Z,"","",,,

2.	McRaven/Yang can not possibly hurt Biden. If the polls show it hurting the left disproportionately, I am convinced to a moral certainty Yang would drop out yet again, the only result of a ticket without him being that Trump is the one to suffer if McRaven did not drop out. 

Given those two conclusions, the only course of action is to switch gears and support the best candidates now—it hurts nothing, but could change everything for the better when the two candidates are so especially weak.

How is it helpful? 

OD is Creationism is religion and is so banned from the public schools.

I have deliberately shifted back and forth between ssying Designers and saying God. You have never corrected me. Is ""God did it"" different from ""the Designers did it""? If so how?



I did not looking at the other thread. Please stop this dance to avoid. In this thread we were discussing the mechanism for a boiling kettle. You tried to turn that to a discussion of different notions of cause. Talk about mechanism. Is ""God did it"" a mechanism? I'd there any reason I can't say the Designers stress why the kettle boiled *as a mechanism*?



>ID does the same


Then show me. Evolution, change over time and common descent, are the organizing principle to biology. Evolution explains why mammalia is a group, it explains why we fish is not. Tell me how unknown actions by unknown beings with unknown abilities helps me organize organisms. Tell me how I can predict based on God/the Designers did it"".

By philosophy you mean methodological naturalism, right? The foundation of science. You mean that ID is science without naturalism.

See for astronomy and geology. Try to recreate a star or a volcano. 

>the scientific method can and has been applied.

That begs the question of what of the scientific method. In real science you find specific testable predictions and tests of those predictions. ID hasn't done that at all. 

>As for predictions made by ID, ID predicts we will find specified complexity in nature and we do. 


Specified complexity is meaningless. What actual prediction does it make?

>ID predicts that we will find the reusage of parts and functions across different organisms and we do.

2020-06-24T23:38:44Z,socialgist,"That's absolutely fair, and well taken. And to be clear, I'm not assuming that Bolton is lying necessarily. Human memory is highly fallible, so I wouldn't be surprised if at some point Trump said something that Bolton, months or years later, remembered one way, perhaps mangling it with Trump's horrific remarks about Tienanmen. My only claim here is that Bolton's claim, at least at face value, seems implausible, even for Trump. It would be strange even assuming Bolton's general depiction of Trump were accurate. 

And it would be stranger still for Bolton, of all people, to take offense at it. Keep in mind, in this very same book, he says that the turning point for him, the thing that made him realize that Trump was a hopeless cause, was Trump's 11th hour decision to call off an attack on Iran when he learned that there could be a high death toll of Iranians. Bolton wanted the attack, so Trump shying away from it offended his sensibilities.

So, I can't claim to know with any certainty who's telling the truth here.

2020-06-24T23:40:05Z,socialgist,"Sorry for the late reply.  I saw your response, but was unable to respond.

First off, I don’t only watch CNN.  I don’t watch much of it at all, cause I don’t like it.  I get my news from many sources to try and stay abreast on different trains of thought.  I even dabble in your favorite, FOX news, from time to time.  Gotta tune in to hear the new gospel according to trump.

I’m not going to show you all of the references and lies he spouts.  There is an incredible amount.  I’ve given trump the benefit of the doubt before, but he has proven time and again that he will say dumb shit.  Your stance that I’m taking all of it “out of context” is silly.  The same shit is said with every tweet he makes, or whatever he yells at a rally.  It’s all the desperate rankings of a madman.  He’s said plenty of hateful things just this week.  I guess it’s not hateful if it’s hurting the right people, right?  It’s either he was joking, in jest, wasn’t serious, it’s code for something else, or we are taking it out of context.  So you all either somehow get the jokes, understand some code of dumb, or you believe and agree with it.  There’s no code or context to dumb shit...  it’s simply dumb shit.  There’s no joke if no one gets it.  Believing and agreeing with his rants is the most asinine.  I’d rather you all were just honest and came out with your racism and/hate.  Instead, you all look and sound like dumb, willfully ignorant fools, playing along with some grand plan that nobody knows the goal of.  I’m not particularly saying you are a hateful racist or something of the like, I’m saying that your endless support and near worship of this man makes you look like you are, so it’s very easy to assume as much.  

He still downplays the virus and insists on less testing...  Because there would be less cases that way.  Brilliant.  He knew he’d be criticized over closing fights down from China.  It was a bold move, but a good move.  Too bad he stopped with that, and thought he’d done enough.  The death toll still rises, and you all still deny the severity.  He still stokes the fires of racism, xenophobia, and bigotry.  He knows you all love that shit.  It’s a crazy fucking time out there.  He chooses division over unity every time.  

Trump’s brilliance is in his con on stupid people.  Dumb people are incredibly easy to take advantage of and control.  He’s done just that.  He’s made dumb people think they are smart and right.  He’s given dumb people a pedestal to preach the word of trump from.  He’s given dumb people a reason to remain ignorant.  He’s never called his following for they all are (dumb), and it empowers them.  They are too dumb to realize they are dumb otherwise.  He’s pulled of the perfect con.  It hurts to watch you all being taking advantage of.  There’s no way to tell the trump herd otherwise.  They are unwilling and maybe incapable of self reflection.  Hateful dumb masses are incredibly dangerous.  This county’s been cultivating it for a long time.  Dumb people.  Ripe for the picking!

Again, I’m not saying you are necessarily dumb or hateful, just that it’s easy to asses that you probably are.",EARL_FACE,https://www.reddit.com/r/dankmemes/comments/heq1aw/sad_clown/fvwljta/,2020-06-24T23:40:05Z,"","",,,

Maybe we can be the ""neighborhood patrol"" that /u/130bpm so desperately needs.

And, if you look at the content of my comments you’ll often see that I get in arguments with people who are bashing progressives. If you’re going to accuse me of bias at least make some effort.

Your criticisms of the generic ballot are mostly fair, but it’s one of the only metrics we have. In an environment that is highly polarized and driven primarily by presidential politics, the presidential race should mirror the generic ballot. The fact that it doesn’t tells us something is up. For instance, the generic ballot also has a generic Democrat with 48% of the vote. National polls currently have Biden at 51%. That means, by definition, he’s doing better than most Democrats (is, it’s not just an anti-Trump thing). Maybe Sanders or Buttigieg would be even higher, but just basic probability says that’s unlikely.

I would love to see the data supporting your argument, but you haven’t provided a shred of evidence to support the opinions you’re trying to masquerade as fact.

I said ""munitions"". This is a wider term to include fired tear gas rounds and concussive grenades, all of which were documented at the time.

I never said it was a Christian protest. I mentioned that they weren't even protesting. They were just inconvenient people in the way of Trump's ""Dear Leader"" style photo op, that would have been perfectly in place if it had been North Korea, China or Russia.

The one thing we will agree on is that she is no bishop and those were no priests. But regardless of the fact they are only half right in their beliefs, they at a minimum represent Christianity to the masses. They are just as worthy of our care and respect due to the fact that they are children of God. And they were tear gassed off of their own property. Even removing the Christian angle that should infuriate any freedom loving Americans. 

Don't fool yourself into thinking he was doing it to send a message about preserving Christianity or some other conspiracy.

Perceptions of someone (that you probably don't even know personally) are no way to choose political courses of action. It doesn't *matter* who you think Bret might be. Good intentions mean diddly squat when the chips are down. Disrupting one of the most consequential presidential elections in several decades with a move that will upset both major parties of government to gain a razor thin chance of victory is monumentally ill-advised. Why would you do that when you've amassed some political capital to implement this or one of hundreds of other strategies for the next election, when you have the advantage of time, foresight, and planning?

This might be different if Trump were leading by 30% or something ridiculous like that. That is literally the only condition where this play would make any sense. I'd argue it's not the best course of action even then.

I will not waste my vote using it to vote for anything less simply because I don't want someone else to win.  All the excuses about the two party system not be resolved quickly or it becoming a two party system with just different parties are just that - excuses.  As long as people bury their heads in the sand and ignore third party candidates nothing will change.  I always consider what will I tell my kids I have done for their future.  I would rather tell them I held on to my values and morals and voted my conscience than tell them I compromised it on the hopes that putting a different tyrant in would change things.  Because let's be honest as long as we keep having to chose between candidates like Trump and Biden things won't improve. You claim I have guilt but you're wrong.  I have pride that I have never compromised my values regardless of how many times people tell me my vote is wasted. If you're okay with people compromising their values than I have little surprise you're okay with voting for either of the main party candidates. That compromise perfectly illustrates how they arrived in the place they are today.  

And there's that old ""after the election is when the real work begins""...  Really?!  That is said every four years and every four years, regardless of the party that gets in, things get worse.

So Trump leaves office (a given at this point) then we have the status quo Democrat establishment politicians using the same tactics they have used for years to continue the erosion.

Like, where’s the fucking humour in Instagram = bad and reddit = good I’m sure no one apart from your soyboy friends would believe you if you said that.

Secondly - from what I’ve seen the whole of reddit has a clear majority opinion that trump = bad. Now, I have no political opinion in regards to America’s system and I am not saying in any way that trump is good (my dad is affected by his travel ban), but as an Australian I feel like that Reddit is mostly Americanised (which does make sense), so I’d much rather watch Aussie youtubers talk about how our prime minister shat himself at McDonalds a while back. And many moderators feel the need to censor and remove posts which they don’t like and go against their political agenda, which is really unprofessional and unbiased. Also reddit is run by the Chinese government, which means they can control everything we see (they also put large tariffs on our trade with them so they’re not in our good pages)

The Nazis didn't invent that kind of code, alphabetic numeration has been used for centuries and it's hardly some revolutionary concept. I've heard kids using a similar system to talk in code for fun. It's also a common way of getting around censors in countries like China. I cannot overstate how absolutely dumbfounding it is that you take issue with this. Either you're a concern troll or monumentally stupid.

>You don't need citation to say most of the population is dumb as fuck 

How can you be a socialist yet have such little respect for your fellow human beings?

>Do you really think most of your Reddit socialist buddies have political science degrees?

You don't need a degree to understand socialism enough to get behind it as an ideology and try to teach others. Do you think capitalism came about because everyone in the world had an intricate understanding of it at the most advanced level? This is some hefty gatekeeping.

>What kind of pivot was that? Idk what you're even talking about

You call people LARPers for not having a degree level understanding of socialism and spreading misinformation yet you made the baseless claim that 90% of Reddit socialists are not real socialists. I was pointing out the hypocrisy.

I was talking about the left although I think a lot of Trump supporters are naive and brainwashed rather than malicious.

Then why are you talking about politics online? If you don't have any faith in my honesty or intelligence why even bother debating? If you're coming at me assuming from the beginning that I'm dumb or lying you're acting in bad faith.

>I'm all out of good faith

Then honestly stop being a voice of socialism online. If you're unwilling to respect people you disagree with and approach them in good faith you are actively harming the cause. It is impossible to develop a robust set of beliefs when you don't allow them to be challenged and instead assume everyone challenging you is invalid.

I must not be explaining my original line of questioning well based on your responses. So I will abandon it.

>The TPA one? That was like 99% people below 22 years old probably. Almost 0% of chance of problems for them.

Is the problem for them or for the people they could spread it to?

>I can't believe after a month of Democrat mass protesting, where health professionals, Democrat pooiticians, Democrat youths, voters, corporations, tv shows, etc. ... did a total 180⁰, ...

I opposed all of that and continue to oppose it. I'm a Republican for what it's worth. I find my left-leaning friends to have a lot of cognitive dissonance over mass gatherings right now.

>we're now gonna return to try again at shaming Trump supporters for gatherings.

>That attack line is dead. That ship has sailed.

I'm not making an attack or trying to shame anyone right now. I don't think this was any worse than the protests--though I oppose both on the grounds of safety in cities experiencing outbreaks right now.

----------

I'm trying to understand what your threshold is for when a political rally is and isn't worth the risk?

Sounds like you think this one is worth it? Ok. I'll try a couple more to see if I can get a general sense of the lines you draw here.

There were thousands of people gathered in the streets and parks of NYC for Juneteenth marches and protests. Those were outdoors but had a wider range of ages and more people in attendance. NYC had a worse outbreak in the past but it doesn't seem to be spiking as much in recent days as some other places.

This is a past event--so whatever unknowns you want to look into to decide if it was a good idea to have such a mass gathering, we can.

The community that Kinda Funny is trying to build is almost impossible on the internet, even though it’s a commendable goal. A community that truly includes everyone and looks at everyone equally. Trump represents just about the opposite of that. He thrives off of pushing for divisiveness and putting one side against the other. 

I’m sorry if you don’t feel welcome in this community anymore, but I think the point of the message of “if you support trump you’re not welcome here”, is less about trump and more about what he represents.

You probably have a negative view of each. ""Libertarian"" means ""moderate anarchist,"" though they are usually working with a more right wing framework.

I am more of an ""IRA"" kind of guy. People should be in charge of their own communities, and decide things democratically There. It should be defended *by the people* and the people should all be active participants in it. 

To me Socialists are ""comrade."" (Healthcare is a right. The police are fucked. The rich are the bad guys and should have some portion of their stuff seized for all the taxes we were forced to pay and they dodged. The hippies = good, Confederate = bad. Nazis are evil and don't deserve to live near decent folk.)

Nationalists are frequently horrified that We agree. (I'm pro gun, anti-china, anti-censorship, against buying foreign or from international companies)

To me Libertarians are ""selfish anarchists,"" so they're ""friend"" and ""asshole."" (I hate the fed. I'm anti-gun laws, anti-taxing of any one *but* the current rich, and want all taxes to become voluntary at the local level. I work for myself. I want to abolish the ATF and the Fed, I want to return to the Constitutional model with state's governing themselves.)

i don't think these current crises really affect trump's base very much. despite drawing lower crowds at rallies, his base remains very engaged online.

trump has been making concessions towards the group of voters that are most reliable -- senior citizens. lowering the price of insulin for medicaid recipients is a big deal. ""law and order"" bluster also appeals to old people, fearful about rioters and protests.

I've been watching elections since the late 70s and nothing can save this election for Trump. I recall the Reagan Mondale blowout of 84, well this will be almost as bad for Trump as it was for Mondale. Even tampering won't be enough this time. Republicans just like Democrats don't like a big loser, and won't want his influence on the party after the year is up. The super red states don't matter as they aren't going to to vote blue regardless. 

The Republicans will revert to a more moderate form of centrist politics as the progressives take over the Democrats. The country will move left of center soon and eventually progress to a more globalist idiology. The regressives have hurt their movement by allowing a baffoon to lead them. It will be hard to trust them for awhile.

2020-06-24T23:45:03Z,socialgist,"Almost none of what you said is true. 

The last two times a Republican has won us been a stolen election. Bush with the Supreme Court and Trump with Russian and Chinese help. If you actually read the Mueller report and not just the Barr pipe dream summary, you may actually realize it was never a “hoax” as conservatives like to pretend. 

We called him a Russian asset because of what he was saying and doing... which made him 100% look like one. How are you guys so blind??

Obama won because of the people voting for him, it was open and shut, nothing to even raise about that. 

Trying to act like conservatives didn’t throw the biggest shit storm over every little thing Obama did is again complete bullshit. You guys were incessant about every little thing that he __never actually did__. Now we see Trump actually doing what conservatives claim Obama was doing and crickets...

Almost no conservative position is based on any logic or reason. It is developed based on hate and rhetoric and is a virus in this country. That’s why liberals speak out against when Republicans try to spread their vitriol.

Almost ever bad decision / circumstance over the past 30 years can be directly attributed to the bad faith politics practiced by Republicans.

2020-06-24T23:45:07Z,socialgist,"I've said this before, and I hope it holds up.

Barr DOES NOT have the same influence and protection that Trump does.

Trump is really good at protecting himself, but he's really terrible at legally defending other people in his inner circle from being arrested, impeached, or otherwise legally arrested. Just look at Roger Stone. For all of Trump's bluster and attempting to protect his buddy from the ramifications, he's still going to prison.

If Barr is thrown into an impeachment scandal, it's going to tarnish his reputation. He will forever be remembered as ""one of the only AG in history to be dealt serious impeachment charges; possibly treasonous or defiance of office charges.""

It will impact Trump, but it will impact Barr a hell of a lot more. In fact, Trump will ultimately be forced to choose between two things. ""Barr didn't do anything wrong and I will force this narrative until you accept it"" and ""Barr is scum, I never knew what a bad guy he was, and [this has nothing to do with me](https://www.businessinsider.in/politics/world/news/trump-said-he-was-not-involved-in-us-attorney-geoffrey-bermans-ouster-minutes-after-ag-barr-told-berman-trump-fired-him/articleshow/76488410.cms).""

Count on it. If Barr gets thrown into the impeachment loop, he will be at the mercy of Republicans that will be forced to side with whatever twisted perspective that Trump takes.

> But the poll showed that prospect could be jeopardized by a substantial concern, shared by a fifth of probable Clinton voters, about letting Democrats control both Congress and the White House again. Forty-eight percent of those polled said that if Mr. Clinton won re-election it would be better to have a Republican Congress to check him; only 41 percent wanted a Democratic Congress, too.

> epublicans have done their own polling and found even more dramatic results, according to one highly placed party worker, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. He said their data suggest that as many as 10 percent of the electorate might abandon their Democratic House candidate when confronted with the risk of giving the Democrats undivided control in Washington.

> The advice to candidates to stress the ''blank check'' argument is being offered to Republican candidates who are running below 50 percent in their own polling. They are being assured, the aide said, that the national Republican headquarters will not be angry with them or cut off their campaign funds if they concede that Mr. Dole will lose and they tried to save themselves.

Yes it is.

You know what isn't constitutional? laws against flag burning. Trying to ban all muslims. Taking funds from the military to build a wall. Having an impeachment trial with no witnesses.

*electing someone who not only has never read the constitution, but actively disagrees with the parts of it that he is aware of*

But now you caer about the constitution?

No - you care about the future, and you know that a well informed populace that is aware of reality means less votes for the GOP. 

NPR provides people with information, and the republican war on information is against that.
>Our target is the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, yes.

Right and you'l fail as you always do because essentially you're arguing to strip educational resources from children because it will cause you to lose votes. Not because of the constitution - you guys are totally fine with breaking the constituon constantly, and proudly support someone who is aggressively against American values. 

>So where does the Constitution allow for NPR or the CPB again? I must have missed that answer.

It's all explained here:

https://www.npr.org/about-npr/178660742/public-radio-finances

Just because you insist something is unconstitutional, doesn't make it so. 

You think having a TV show that teaches children to read and write is unconstitutional. You think money is speech. You think the first ammendment should be altered to include flag burning. You were on the wrong side of every equal rights battle regarding the constitution.

The main groups organizing on behalf of BLM in Madison have openly defended rioting and vandalism as “contributions to liberation.” They’ve also said that “our organizations will not denounce any black persons display of grief and or rage.” And that “all actions against racist state violence are justified, and we will not minimize these contributions to liberation.”

Yes. You will pay more taxes. 

Your overall cost is less, more people are covered. Nobody goes bankrupt because they get sick. Preventable deaths due to not having insurance go away. Care is better. Nobody loses insurance when they lose their job, have a spouse die, turn 26, etc. I could go on. 

The only reason it’s framed in taxes is because that’s the only way it can be smeared. And even that is disingenuous because everyone with insurance pays more in taxes right now. It’s just a private tax to your insurance company. So you have to rely on taxes because it’s the only leg you have to stand on. Any other metric, you lose. Medicare for all isn’t the only answer. It’s just the best one and the only one that doesn’t have millions of people uninsured and tens of thousands dying every year because they don’t have insurance.

Let’s look at other factors.   Obama frequently admitted that he made mistakes.

Obama was frequently praised for being humble- not exactly a term one associates with Trump.   Trump is a man that loves to brag about having the biggest and the best.  Three days into his presidency he got upset about reports that Obama had a bigger inauguration crowd- not surprising that he did given that he was the first African American President.   Trump loves to have his name plastered all over the place.  Loves the sounds of his own voice so much and craves the attention from the crowd so much that he continued campaign rallies even though the campaign has barely begun.

The reason why this shit worries me is because American social issues are being copy-pasted to our continent with a small delay, because our journalists do nothing but slobber corporate American media's cock. 

My grandfather died of the fucking virus and a week later there were hundreds or sometimes even thousands of (mostly white) protesters gathering around in cities, mindlessly shouting the exact same slogans and doing the exact same gestures, with most non-right wing majors doing absolutely nothing to it, while a general protest prohibition was active due to Corona. It also led to some statues being vandalized and looting in the capital. At least our national politicians came to their senses rather quickly (a miracle if you ask me, considering the state of our government right now), and sanity was restored despite our own media trying to keep things aflame for longer.

The whole thing looks like a global corporate power take-over attempt to me, based on a perverted form of liberalism and using Maoist tactics.

And my point is that not supporting Biden is contrary to the goals you claim to have.

The difference is that supporting Romney in 2012 would not have been helpful to progressive causes. Supporting Biden in 2020 is helpful to progressive causes; not ideal, but moving in the right direction, especially with progressives in congress pushing good legislation.

Also think of it as paving the way for a future progressive POTUS. You're making that progressive POTUS's job so much easier by not letting Trump fill the courts with right-wing ideologues whose lifetime appointments would make them obstacles to progress for decades to come. You were complaining about strategies earlier, but the strategy you're advocating makes real progress less likely for decades.

Under Obama, children coming to the country illegally would be held, processed, and released to facilities like foster homes or adult sponsors.  Children coming with family members would be held with the family members in federal detention, which wasn't perfect, but they at least had hygiene and care standards. And then they would be released, pending the adult's hearing on whether they can stay in the country.

What Trump did was decide to criminally prosecute every single adult entering the country.  Under federal law, children can't be detained with adults awaiting prosecution.  So, where do these children who would have otherwise been detained with their family go now?  Trump had to establish these ad-hoc CPB facilities that are hastily built in tent cities or on old army bases or in warehouses.  Some are administered by federal contractors who don't give any fucks about anything.  Of course, Trump didn't go through the proper legislative channels, so there was no additional money appropriated for this.  No money means no standards.  And then you get the filthy, dangerous conditions that have appalled those who have been able to see what it's like inside Trump's camps.

I’m not convinced of this. First, the express purpose of the strategy is to get a mixed ticket. Biden/Pence is a win in my book. And furthermore, I’m not sure they would try to impeach anyone, but even if they did, we know for a fact that impeachment votes will always be partisan—the result with Trump proves that Congress will only vote for their own re-election interests, both sides.

2020-06-24T23:49:23Z,socialgist,"As a response to the Trump Administration's recent push to abolish DACA, undocumented immigrants' livelihoods are at stake now. Although the POTUS failed to abolish Dreamers' security, the events that took place last week have clearly demonstrated that it's possible for some political figure to strip their rights. As a solution, I believe that America needs to adopt an open-borders policy to protect our immigrants from xenophobic policies. **Note: All data will be linked at the bottom of post

1.) Here's an analogy: A poor person from Lousiana could pay for a plane ticket and fly all the way over to a Hawaii, a state far away from the continental US without worrying about obtaining a visa, green card, or passport (really only a small background check & scanning for weapons); but a Mexican who wants to migrate from the southern border to El Paso has to go through that process? There's a much larger cultural and change in demographics between moving from Louisiana to Hawaii than Northern Mexico to El Paso.

2.) America previously had open borders between 1850 and 1920 and it worked well. Granted, it was only granted to Europeans because people of systematic racism. Nevertheless, in 1890, immigrants accounted for 14.8% of the population at the time. There were no issues at the time with crime or cultural integration. This should've always been the case. Immigrants are normal people who should be able to freely immigrate to our country whenever.

3.) Undocumented/Documented immigrants do not commit more crime than normal citizens. In 2015, undocumented immigrants made up 6.4% of Texas's total population, but accounted for 5.4% of homicides. On the contrary, native Texans make up 83% of the population but committed 93% of all homicides in 2015. The assertion that undocumented immigration must be strictly controlled because of homicidal rates is false, far-right fear-mongering propaganda. 

To conclude, opening America's borders up for all immigrants and refugees is vital because they work normal jobs, pay taxes, and introduce different cultures and politics to the country. It's incredibly disheartening hearing how conservatives have framed immigrants as disgusting and crime-filled for many decades. Ultimately, America was built on immigrants; some of it was voluntary while others was involuntary (slavery).

Again you're being pedantic. Because this portion of the article has fuck all to do with the overall number of deportations. Those are cold, hard numbers.  Obama deported more people than trump on average every year until 2019.

That's how it works when you make a conspiratorial claim. You have to defend it, not declare it fact and challenge everybody else to tell you why you're wrong.

>What if you voted for Biden and someone changed your vote to Trump 

This doesn't happen. You're fearmongering with something that historically does not happen. I have no obligation to inform you of mail-in ballots and their security since I am not the one disputing the claims from all academics and researchers that study elections, but I'd rather not see your lack of critical thinking spread to other readers so i'll detail why you're uninformed:

​

* [The Heritage Foundation (a right-wing think tank) maintains an online database of election fraud cases](https://www.heritage.org/voterfraud)
* [The Heritage Foundation is a conservative think tank that even the White House references](https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/docs/pacei-voterfraudcases.pdf)
*  Over the course of the past 20 years there have been just over 1200 total cases of voter fraud of all forms
*  250 million votes have been cast by a mail ballot nationally while 204 involved the fraudulent use of absentee ballots; 143 resulted in criminal convictions
* That's 0.00006% of total votes cast 
* [Five states currently conduct all elections entirely by mail: Colorado, Hawaii, Oregon, Washington and Utah. At least 21 other states have laws that allow certain smaller elections, such as school board contests, to be conducted by mail](https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/all-mail-elections.aspx)
* In most states ballots are sealed, marked with barcodes or data that only the voter would know (last 4 SSN for example) so they can't be duplicated and are tied directly to the voter, require a signature, and require ballot signatures to be verified against a signature on file. Other tactics include different styles of paper, weight of the paper, etc that change every election
* Additional measures taken by states include 24 hour surveillance of ballot drop off locations, mandating workers cannot be alone with ballots at any time, and notifying every voter when their ballot has been received.
* Because of the above, and how prone to cyber attacks our voting machines are, mail-in voting is regarded as more secure than in-person voting.
* [Trump also disbanded his newly created Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity after it failed to find cases of voter fraud](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/03/us/politics/trump-voter-fraud-commission.html)
* [Finally, even though I think John Oliver is pretty cringe, he does a good job of detailing how insanely difficult it would be to commit mass voter fraud with mail-in ballots](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-nEHkgm_Gk)

So no, you shouldn’t speak on this until you are informed on the matter and can at the very least provide evidence of widespread voter fraud.

In the following paragraph your recognize hers a shitty person and that's a good thing.


>I do not think Trump is a good person, I do not think he's the best president but I also don't think he's been the worst president in the history of this country. I do not agree with much of what he says, especially on twitter. He's not a politician and has never been socially inept.


You recognized a lot of things and that's great, I get the vibe you wouldnt vote for him again, shit happens man.


In regards to your second point:

>Toward the end of the podcast there was talk about Cool Greg's twitter (I didn't see the post and don't actually follow him) but what really bothered me was that it came off as the group trying to mold and change Greg away from his ideals and beliefs.


Yes, they are trying to mold cool greg. Just like any impressionable person, he needs guidance and that's okay. He is still young and from a rougher lifestyle and sometimes people need help and someone to take them under their wing and it's awesome that he has that support system to help him. A lot of times he may not realize how offensive something actually is or goes ahead and just likes all responses without giving it a second thought. The guy needs a bit of guidance and that's fine. They arent changing who he fundamentally is.


In regards to your third point:

>Even though they talked about being ok with conservatives it came across as saying that to save face

I cant disagree more! Trump and republicans/conservatives dont go hand in hand. Trump is a separate entity entirely. Trumps a shitty human being. They clearly talk about how they can understand more conservative viewpoints despite not agreeing with them. 


From how you have described yourself I do think you belong here. You're a conservative who voted trump previously - shit happens - but you talk about how you dont support his behaviour and the person you have realized that he is. As long as you arent one of the countless shitty -isms you're welcome here.



Edit: to be clear though, if you STILL support trump at this point in time then no. You're not welcomed here.

Lincoln ended the war and united the country. Soooo..... Not a good way to try and make a point. 

State infrastructure does not involve the federal government. The governments extent of interaction starts and stops with regulations. Which yes. Trump removed a lot of them at the cost of the environment that some of these infrastructures neighbor. But that's not something to get hysterical about. It has its pros and cons. But unfortunately the pros are becoming less every day as coal is being outpaced by clean energy year after year. In fact many of the jobs trump created in the coal energy sector are already gone or will soon be.

As for bridges and roads and the like. Trump had nothing to do with them. Period.

2020-06-24T23:51:40Z,socialgist,"In Australia you can mail in but honestly it’s more of a hassle than it’s worth. We hold our elections on a weekend and they are run by a federal independent organisation. 

The districts aren’t very big(population wise) and for the most part, gerrymandering doesn’t exist. We use preferential voting, ie place a number 1 on the candidate’s you want and then 2,3,4, etc on the next best candidates. 

We use paper ballots and we count pretty quick. If you have more than 50% of the vote in the first round of counting you win. 

If there is no candidate with 50% of the vote after the first round, the lowest voted candidates votes get given to the second preference candidate and this continues till someone has more than 50%. This is a pretty good system because it gets the most agreed upon candidate voted in. Which allows independents to get voted in more frequently. 

It normally takes me less than an hour to get in and vote. But there are always multiple voting places and some are in other districts so if one place has too many people you can always go vote somewhere else. It’s also mandatory to vote, if you don’t you get a small fine of 50 dollars but IIRC it increases over time.

2020-06-24T23:52:23Z,socialgist,"> Note this data is only for the US but the idea applies

Thats pretty much the crux of my point, because something is true of the US does not make it true elsewhere. That it is not the notion of Government or regulation that is failing, it is the implementation of it. 

Primarily while I dont disagree with your views on the American system I think it is deeply misplaced to apply that to other places. 

Take banking regulations. We have very tight banking regulations and lending rules. When the GFC happened we avoided a recession. In fact Covid has ended a near 20 year run without a recession in Australia... Our regulations are focused primarily on integrity of systems, consumer protection, and encouraging competition (through reduced barriers of entry).

Take your example of the ER and doctor shopping. While it happens here it is not even close to what you describe. Opioids are increasingly being placed in the most tightly controlled schedule for medication and states have put in place tracking measures. For anything beyond mild opioids you cannot get more than one script, and if you did, you wouldnt be able to fill multiple scripts within a State.

Also thats not what happens when someone shows up to an ER here. For a variety of reasons, one being there is no incentive because the hospital is not being paid in that way. 

By outcomes I mean health outcomes. It is worth noting that Australia per capita spends far less than America on health (even though ours is a nationalised system), has a higher quality of life, and on every metric has a more advanced hospital system delivered more affordably. It is what it is.

>The reason why I think you're being duped is you don't really realize how much you're actually paying in taxes (a shitload, way more than just your income tax) and you're defending it because it's ""not so bad"" but you would be so much wealthier without the government constantly stealing your money and you've given no reasons why they need to provide the rules for businesses that they take advantage of and the monopolies of the industries they hold. Even if all you paid in taxes were just your income tax, you're still getting screwed over like crazy. Imagine $30k/year annually... and you're just happy your $200 doctors visit is covered.

Firstly, there is no Government monopoly on business (except the broadband network wholesale company but that will only remain Government owned until the rollout is complete and then it will be sold). 

Fundamentally we are not going to get anywhere. Unless you are willing to accept that systems and circumstances play a role in relationships with Government there is not much point...",tofutak7000,https://www.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/hdran9/so_this_is_concerning_trump_is_attempting_to/fvwmowg/,2020-06-24T23:52:23Z,"","",,,

## Perpetrator

Haider lived in [Narre Warren, Victoria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narre_Warren,_Victoria), and was of [Afghan descent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghan_Australians).  He began attending lectures at the fundamentalist Al-Furqan mosque. He  was also believed to be connected to prominent Islamic State recruits  Neil Prakash and Sevdet Besim.[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Endeavour_Hills_stabbings#cite_note-news.com-inquest-2)[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Endeavour_Hills_stabbings#cite_note-3) 

Haider was one of between 40 and 50 Australian citizens who had  had their passports cancelled due to fears that they would join the [Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_State_of_Iraq_and_the_Levant).[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Endeavour_Hills_stabbings#cite_note-time-1) 

The [Australian Security Intelligence Organisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Security_Intelligence_Organisation)  (ASIO) had been monitoring his rapid radicalisation, which took place  during a period of only a few months, but had not judged him dangerous.[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Endeavour_Hills_stabbings#cite_note-DaveyRapidRadicalization-4) 

## Attack

Haider is  reported to have gone to the police station to discuss his cancelled  passport. Two police officers from the Joint Counter-Terrorism Team  (JCTT), one from [Victoria Police](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_Police) and the other from the [Australian Federal Police](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Federal_Police)  (AFP), approached him in the car park. Haider produced a knife and  slashed the Victorian officer across the arm. He turned on the AFP  officer and first stabbed him in the face and chest. When the AFP  officer collapsed, Haider climbed on top of him and repeatedly stabbed  him. The first officer, who had been slashed across the arm, ordered  Haider to drop the weapon, then shot him fatally in the head.[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Endeavour_Hills_stabbings#cite_note-5) 

Haider was carrying two knives and the [Black Standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Standard) flag.[\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Endeavour_Hills_stabbings#cite_note-6) 

## Reaction

Australian Prime Minister [Tony Abbott](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Abbott),  whom Haider had allegedly threatened during the stabbing, stated,  ""Obviously this indicates that there are people in our community who are  capable of very extreme acts. It also indicates that the police will be  constantly vigilant to protect us against people who will do  Australians harm.""[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Endeavour_Hills_stabbings#cite_note-time-1) 

Three days before the attack, [ISIL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISIL) propagandist [Abu Mohammad al-Adnani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_Mohammad_al-Adnani) gave a speech calling for ISIL sympathisers to attack countries including Australia. Professor Greg Barton of Melbourne's [Monash University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monash_University)  Global Terrorism Research Centre stated his opinion that the attack was  not inspired by the message. He called for community engagement to  prevent attacks from people suspected of terrorism.[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Endeavour_Hills_stabbings#cite_note-time-1) 

Victoria's police commissioner stated that bag searches would mean longer queuing for the [2014 AFL Grand Final](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_AFL_Grand_Final) at [Melbourne Cricket Ground](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melbourne_Cricket_Ground) on 27 September.[\[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Endeavour_Hills_stabbings#cite_note-7) 

[*The Age*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Age)  newspaper put a photograph of an innocent man, Abu Bakar Alam, on the  front page, mistakenly identifying him as the perpetrator of the attack.  As part of the settlement the newspaper donated $20,000 towards  building a [mosque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosque) in [Doveton, Victoria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doveton,_Victoria).[\[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Endeavour_Hills_stabbings#cite_note-8) 

An [inquest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inquest) into Haider's death began on 7 March 2016.[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Endeavour_Hills_stabbings#cite_note-news.com-inquest-2) 

In 2017, U.S. President [Donald Trump](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump) listed this stabbing as an example of an ""under-reported"" terrorist attack.[\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Endeavour_Hills_stabbings#cite_note-UnderReportedTrump-9)",skeletor_thagawd,https://www.reddit.com/r/masskillers/comments/hfc7r3/18yearold_abdul_numan_haiders_profile_picture_on/fvwmsum/,2020-06-24T23:54:01Z,"","",,,

Russia gave Trump money. You better be consistent and defend him and say he’s not corrupt. 

One of two things is the case. 

1. Politicians know that if they give big money donors legislative favors, they will see large amounts of money to help keep them in power. So they do what their donors say. This is corruption. 

2. The big money donors strategically pick candidates who agree with them and give them money to get a candidate in office to pass the legislative agenda they want. This isn’t corruption, but it’s still nonsense that shouldn’t be tolerated. 

Donald Trump was endorsed by David Duke and the KKK has given him money directly for his campaign. I don’t care if there is a spoken agreement between them. All I know is Trump is racist and pushing a racist  agenda.

2020-06-24T23:54:41Z,socialgist,"> Donald Trump voted “absentee a couple of weeks ago,” White House spokesman Hogan Gidley told Quartz today (Nov. 6). In doing so, Trump joined an estimated 40 million US voters, up from the 27.5 million who voted early in the 2014 midterms, according to the [United States Election Project](http://www.electproject.org/2018_analysis).

It is an improvement, and I'm glad that they will fade into distant memories/museums.

If you however disregard this demographic there will be no lasting change to the status quo. Some protestors are willing to tear down the wrong statues and not only LOSE the widespread support they currently wield, but also strengthen the right wing by playing into their narrative and driving the moderates toward them. It's election year, and I have so far seen several people go from Biden/Undecided to straight up Trump Ride or die because they are eating up the narrative which some of the Protestors only feed into. Do not underestimate this possible PR damage.

To put it into perspective within your story:

2020-06-24T23:54:54Z,socialgist,"I'm somewhat of a lurker here myself, but I wanted to chip in regarding your situation, as it can easily be misconstrued. The statements being made by Greg, Andy, and Kinda Funny as a whole are drawing attention to the fact that Trump has, in his years of office, proven time and time again that he is a racist, sexist, transphobic, homophobic, and all around shitty dude. It is clearly evident that the man has used his Twitter to polarize these topics (race, sexuality, etc.) into a political opinion. They are not. These are topics of human rights. So, regardless of your feelings towards his approach on economics, there is a fundamentally more important issue at stake, primarily the health and safety of the millions of Americans that aren't white, that aren't straight, that aren't cis. What that means is that supporting Trump in 2020 is an indication that you're willing to tolerate such injustices, even if you personally wouldn't consider yourself someone with such a belief. Kinda Funny and its community will not accept any position where such vile behavior is tolerated, because for many, it is a matter of life and death.

In saying so, I also want to draw attention to the fact that everyone, myself included, make mistakes. In 2016, I was excited to see what Trump would do to the world of politics. I was ready for a change. But the insurmountable evidence over these four years have shown he is a disgusting man who believes that rape, violence, and human lives mean nothing to him. 

I don't want you to feel that you are evil or the sole force fighting an insurmountable battle, I just ask that you consider the topics I and many others have broached.

Of course, that's only taking into account confirmed cases, which means people who were asymptomatic or didn't go out to get tested (lack of data) are missing from the calculation.

This means that the mortality rate is actually probably closer to 1% as you say, in either case a 1 / 100 change of dying from this virus is pretty horrific once you scale it up to a higher value.

Obama was a total piece of shit.  He just knew how to smile and wasn't a racist or rapist.  He refused to close Guantanamo Bay, refused to take us out of the Middle East, gave us the most mediocre healthcare reform possible (subsidization of private insurance companies) despite having full control of the government for about 2 years, renewed the PATRIOT Act, was absolutely unwilling to pardon Snowden for blowing the whistle on the IC, and (as you already acknowledged, although without detail), upped drone strikes with a 90% collateral rate in its killings.

Note that this is the second time this month that Barr has made these claims about counterfeit ballots (earlier this month in a [NYT interview](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/01/magazine/william-barr-attorney-general.html)).  It's dead obvious that they're trying to set the stage for some fuckery in November and not necessarily in the direct form that some may expect (voter suppression and fudging the numbers electronically -- though I regard none of these tactics as mutually exclusive of others).  

But if there's a little voter suppression here, a few numbers fudged there, and then you throw in some ""fake Democrat ballots"" in some key areas then they kind of have all the horseshit they need to claim that they're victims of election rigging (and/or that results from ""questionable"" districts should be invalidated).

2020-06-24T23:57:00Z,socialgist,"I was young when I was right-wing.

It started like this, I was 12, I was bored of school and wanted to know/learn/hear people talk about politics, my parents were moderately conservative and my dad sometimes listened to Rush Limbaugh and other right-wing AM radio shows. I started listening to them.

I developed an inaccurate perception of how liberals thought and behaved, those radio programs kind of train people to think of liberals in a certain way. I found myself becoming angry about the Clinton administration. Specifically affirmative action and illegal immigration.

At 18 I voted for George W. Bush, I followed his presidency closely and he started doing things I did not like. Extremely quickly into his presidency, I soured on him due to him not separating church/state. 

After 9/11 I became very concerned in a pointless protracted war. I was 19 or 20, and I fully abandoned any old vestiges of conservatism. I briefly got into Marx and socialist philosophy, watched Democracy Now!, read Zinn and Chomsky and by 2004 at 23 or so voted for Ralph Nader and was involved with leftist causes. 

At some point around 2004, I also started to become more self-questioning and decided that I would be less emotional and develop my own solid philosophy. Ever since I've basically come to be and have been for the last 15 years, basically a Social Democrat.

I don't believe that markets or capitalism are bad, but I believe the government can through law, regulations, and institutions temper the negative elements of capitalism. I believe in individual freedom, I believe in globalism and results-based policies. I don't believe that the best answer is the more left-wing answer or the most right-wing answer I try and look at the evidence and make my best-educated guess. This had led me to become, I guess a mainstream democrat. 

I essentially fit the definition of the type of person that has drifted left. A college-educated professional who lives in the suburbs. 

If Trump was around when I was 18 if he were president when I was a teenager I would have been left-wing from the beginning most likely. The direction the republican party has gone is disgraceful. I am no fan of the far left either...however I am about the opposite of a right-wing populist. I'll never in my life ever vote for anyone who even supported Trump momentarily, it shows a bad character or bad judgment at the very least. 

Anyway. TLDR: I was confused and let idiots tell me what a liberal was. Then I got closer to the truth but overcorrected. I have had a consistent center-left worldview for 14 or 15 years. My interest in philosophy and thinking and social science research and THE TRUTH led me here.",thebigmanhastherock,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskALiberal/comments/hf9mvm/folks_here_who_used_to_lean_right_what_made_you_a/fvwmzmu/,2020-06-24T23:57:00Z,"","",,,

Ok, so Shapiro uses the term, which goes to your main point. Hadn't really seen that as I don't watch him a lot, but I have noted he is willing to be critical of Trump. Who Shapiro endorses will tell us how seriously he regards Trump's flaws weighed against the flaws of the other candidates. 

> How are we not a failure if we are going by Covid deaths per capita? We are already the [9th worst in the world for mortality per 100k](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/mortality) and yet [are still #1 in the world for new cases](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/new-cases). All other developed nations are squashing their pandemics while we are #1. To add further indictment, we had an extra month warning beyond all of the other countries that have a higher mortality than us. 

I didn't say we weren't a failure, I was wondering about your statement that the U.S. is a **unique** failure, since there are other nations with higher death rates per capita. Regarding your link about ""#1 in the world for new cases,"" that is #1 for total cases, not cases per capita. The U.S. is a big nation so raw numbers are going to be large. I wasn't able to find new cases per capita. But the shape of the U.S. curve definitely doesn't look good, since we seem to be heading for a second peak. So maybe that does qualify as uniquely bad.",2HBA1,https://www.reddit.com/r/IntellectualDarkWeb/comments/hf519r/dissenting_opinion_trump_derangement_syndrome_is/fvwn0vw/,2020-06-24T23:57:35Z,"","",,,

2020-06-24T23:58:52Z,socialgist,"Okay, I don't really want to get into the weeds of the opinion. There's a dissent rebutting its arguments. I haven't read the cases they cite, and I'm probably not going to. I'm going to guess that the same holds for you. Except to say that whatever this is, it is *far* from settled law. The DoJ filing to dismiss a case after obtaining a guilty plea has *never happened before.*

But I have something to say to the ""Flynn got railroaded"" crowd. Something I brought up in a comment last week.

The following is from Flynn's guilty plea:
>On March 7, 2017, FLYNN filed multiple documents with the Department of Justice pursuant to the Foreign Agents Registration Act (""FARA"") pertaining to a project performed by him and his company, the Flynn Intel Group, Inc. (""FIG""), for the principal benefit of the Republic of Turkey (""Turkey project""). In the FARA filings, FLYNN made materially false statements and omissions, including by falsely stating that (a) FIG did not know whether or the extent to which the Republic of Turkey was involved in the Turkey project, (b) the Turkey project was focused on improving U.S. business organizations' confidence regarding doing business in Turkey, and (c) an op-ed by FLYNN published in The Hill on November 8, 2016, was written at his own initiative; and by omitting that officials from the Republic of Turkey provided supervision and direction over the Turkey project.

Flynn admitted to this, but he was not prosecuted for it. Failing to file a FARA registration is a crime. Flynn cannot possibly claim, and as far as I know, never has claimed, that he did not understand this. He was a high-level national security officer. So, he filed it late, after he became NSA. But he then *lied on his corrective registration*. This is quite a bit worse than lying in an FBI interview. Add to that the fact that, just a few months earlier, the DoJ IG had issued a big report saying that they needed to step up their FARA enforcement.

*This* is what they had on Michael Flynn; that, while he was the NSA, he lied about working for Turkey. The 1001 charge wasn't prosecution run amok; it was a plea deal, and a good one, with no prison time. If they'd wanted to give him the full court press, they'd have prosecuted him for this. Instead, he plead to a lesser charge in exchange for cooperation, which he later withheld.

""But that allegation is false, too! They just made him admit to it because they're Trump-hating zealots"", you say. Here's the thing. Flynn had a business partner, Bijan Rafiekian. *He* is being prosecuted *right now*. They just appealed the judge's overturning of the jury's conviction a few weeks ago. And in their case against him, the DoJ talks explicitly and at length about how he did the whole thing with Michael Flynn. One of the many absurdities of this situation is that the DoJ now claims on the one hand that Flynn is totally innocent, and on the other that his business partner committed a bunch of crimes with him. What's your explanation for this contradiction?

One last thing on the ""the FBI had it out for Trump"" thing. I *really* don't understand how people hold this up with a straight face. The FBI kept their investigation secret until after the election. On the other hand, they made an announcement, one that ultimately came to nothing, that was *extremely damaging* to the Clinton campaign right before the election. I just don't see how this squares with an all-out effort by the FBI to take down Trump.",hypersoar,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/hdlwx8/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_june_22_2020/fvwn3md/,2020-06-24T23:58:52Z,"","",,,

Here is a short read, if you're into that sort of thing, that lays the groundwork for a larger argument.

Also, a lot of sentiment of ""conservatism == fascism"" in today's politics stems from a near absolute lack of criticism of trump in today's republican party. Fascism needs a central leader to rally behind and currently the current president has definitely been embracing that role. Every other president in recent memory has, at least felt like they had, a sizable opposition sect within their own political party. Trump doesn't seem to which is more striking considering the sizable opposition he had before he was the republican party nominee in 2016.
