For the record, I am absolutely not watching The Mandalorian. For one, I've already seen it, and Disney's decision to roll it out piecemeal is dumb (same thing goes for Clone Wars S7, which only has 2 eps available instead of the 4 aired in the US).

Hi @DisneyPlusUK, please put ALL Mandalorian eps up. Abandon the release schedule.

So Disney+ finally released in the UK but of course Disney can’t have a proper launch. The Mandalorian has only the first 2 episodes and Tros and Frozen 2 aren’t even on here, but it’s on the US version.

Only two episodes in but The Mandalorian is such a joy to watch for this Star Wars fan especially how the show runners have unabashedly stolen from the western genre yet it still feels part of the expanded universe with plenty of action, drama and humour throughout. https://t.co/9kGDEpS79c	2020-03-24T22:09:40Z	twitter	0	Star Wars Universe	blue

Finally! FINALLY! Got to watch the first two episodes of The Mandalorian; will have to see the rest to judge the show in full, but so far it's really upended my expectations.

It helps that the Mandalorian himself isn't the inhumanly clinical badass he first appears. This is definitely Boba Fett meets Han Solo: a guy who IS as good as he thinks he is, but isn't above being taken off guard and needing to improvise in a panic on a semi-regular basis.	2020-03-24T22:20:40Z	twitter	1	General Disney + & Mandalorian Discussions	blue
More than anything, contrasting The Mandalorian to Rise of Skywalker shows just how much better Star Wars media is when it feels inspired by something *other than Star Wars*. Star Wars should be a diverse, primal melting pot of myths and genres; it can't be a pastiche of itself.	2020-03-24T22:20:41Z	twitter	1	Star Wars Universe	blue

@DisneyPlusUK The UK waited months, it's finally here. I can now watch The Mandalorian for there to only be 2 episodes? Do you want your program to be pirated?

Hey @DisneyPlusUK so we subscribed and we found out that Mandalorian is not even complete and Frozen 2 not available until July??? Wether in the US it was released early because of Covid-19???

@spartakusbund18 Yeah, we watched the first five episodes of the Mandalorian and honestly it didn't really hold my interest. I'll probably end up finishing the season eventually (mostly because I know Giancarlo Esposito is in it and I love him in Breaking Bad/Better Call Saul), but in no rush.	2020-03-25T10:51:02Z	twitter	1	General Disney + & Mandalorian Discussions	blue

Just embarking on The Mandalorian (3 EPs in) and I may be being hasty but I am tempted to say it's the best Star Wars outing since Return of the Jedi. Story, pacing, editing feel the most Star Wars for a while without just doing the same things/pandering.

@subversivejake One reason may be that Disney failed to cope with all the backstory and 'baggage' of SW. Their writers had no idea what to do with Luke, Han et al. The Mandalorian is a clean break.	2020-03-30T10:23:07Z	twitter	1	General Disney + & Mandalorian Discussions	blue

@Scotpol1314 Aye must say Patrick Stewart is looking a little on the frail side. Sad to see, but he's still one of the best actors around, and story wise I'm finding it the more interesting of the two series.

Just finished the final episode of the #Mandalorian and it really is one of the best series I have seen in years. A mix between star wars and them great old westerns from years ago.

Watching The Mandalorian is like watching someone play an RPG. The episodes so far were just a succession of fetch quests, punctuated by boss fights, encounters and set pieces. You can just smell the spinoff Lego Mandalorian and other games in the works.	2020-03-31T07:18:34Z	twitter	1	General Disney + & Mandalorian Discussions	blue

That's episode 4 of The Mandalorian watched. It's growing on me. It's got a certain charm about it that I'm enjoying. Oddly doesn't feel very Star Wars, for some reason, but still enjoyable. PS: That episode wasn't very subtle about borrowing from Akira Kurosawa. https://t.co/dsAIU5x91K	2020-04-03T19:16:23Z	twitter	2	Star Wars Universe	blue

Three and a half episodes in to the Mandalorian and I’m enjoying how refreshingly simple the plot is. He’s basically a Witcher each week right?

Well I can't sleep. So I'm going to babble for a bit. 4 episodes in, what I really like about The Mandalorian is it's simplicity. Simple, straightforward episodes made really well. Bare bones dialogue. Breathing space. In complete contrast to Star Trek Picard...	2020-04-04T02:31:23Z	twitter	1	General Disney + & Mandalorian Discussions	blue
How come the US gets Frozen 2 and Onward when the UK doesn’t?? We have to wait until July 17th for Frozen and god knows when for Onward...? Plus we only have 3 eps of The mandalorian and we had to wait so much longer for it to be available?

The Mandalorian - an interstellar bounty hunter who rarely speaks and whose face we never see. Doesn't sound like a great recipe for blockbusting entertainment, but it's fantastic!

@starwarstuff Something maybe not to do with Jedi and Sith, akin to the Mandalorian but not that.

@dvdthmsdt But Mando is a bounty hunter. I’m not saying it’s a Mandalorian thing. I’m saying that perhaps other bounty hunter guild members decided to use it as the best means of transporting their marks.	2020-04-05T12:42:36Z	twitter	0	General Disney + & Mandalorian Discussions	blue

The mandalorian review: Having finally watched the Mandalorian, I am pleased to announce that this is quite possibly my favorite piece of Star Wars media since the Original trilogy, although that doesn’t raise the bar exceedingly high.

which is a film which is given over 3 hours to develop its plot, whereas the mandalorian only has 30 minutes. However the saving grace of the episode is that it introduces us to Cara Dune, and therefore I am willing to forgive this.	2020-04-06T16:00:25Z	twitter	1	Mandalorian Fan Discussions	blue
The Mandalorian also expands the lore in interesting ways, showing us more about life in the outer-rim, filling in the gaps of the Mandalorian’s (the creed, not the show) story, and providing some insight into how the galaxy evolved post empire.	2020-04-06T16:02:24Z	twitter	1	General Disney + & Mandalorian Discussions	blue
It’s also cool to see some really well filmed action sequences that don’t involve lightsabers for once. In conclusion the Mandalorian is a highly enjoyable ride from beginning to end, and despite its flaws, is generally one of the better pieces of Star Wars media. 9/10 https://t.co/0D88mlurfa	2020-04-06T16:03:02Z	twitter	1	Star Wars Universe	blue

You know they are totally gonna do Revan and Malak as the next Star Wars films and they are gonna mess it up even though it’s the easiest trilogy ever to make.

They chase the remnants of the Mandalorian into space. Film 2, years later they return as Sith, we see them take over the Galaxy or part of it and their ultimate plans.

@swankmotron Hmm do we read this as an 8 episode series focusing on Mando. Or is the series ‘Disney Gallery’ an 8 episode series, with episode 1 focusing on the Mando? I feel it could be the latter. If it were the former surely just call the series BTS of the mandalorian or such like?	2020-04-15T14:04:35Z	twitter	1	General Disney + & Mandalorian Discussions	blue

@Ruleof2Review The Mandalorian (at least episode 1-4 that I've seen) would be such a good formula for a Metroid series to follow. Finding 'the child' as a bounty, upgrading her armour, defying the GF as it's the right thing to do, keeping the armour on, not saying much etc.	2020-04-15T14:19:44Z	twitter	0	General Disney + & Mandalorian Discussions	blue

I've been trying not to give money to Disney as much as possible but seeing as I got six months of Disney plus free I have been watching the Mandalorian and I actually quite like it.

I ask this not to subtweet anyone (although WTF Mandalorian?) but to see if there’s any common denominator with how they were developed and for whom. A drop between seasons is common but so sharply after two episodes is rare.	2020-04-16T07:09:48Z	twitter	4	General Disney + & Mandalorian Discussions	blue

A bit more TV last couple of days after was much more taken by THE MANDALORIAN than expected to be.

There's something really old fashioned about The Mandalorian that I really like. The overarching plot is insanely simple, and each episode is a little subplot that wraps up in half an hour.

@auntielelly Rogue One & Solo are in the 24 hours. Both good movies. Solo doesn't deserve all the criticism. I haven't included Mandalorian but I suppose if you do that there's an argument that The Clone Wars and Rebels animated series should also be included. That's much more than 24 hrs!	2020-04-20T13:11:15Z	twitter	0	Star Wars Universe	blue
@bleddb Oh yes! The Mandalorian is excellent, and it the final two episodes are peak Star Wars content. ?? I feel like there’s the skeleton of a really good story in the sequels, with Rey and Ren struggling with the legacy of their mentors, but it’s bogged down in mystery box bullshit.	2020-04-20T13:22:52Z	twitter	2	Negative Sentiment around Disney +	blue

@ThePoshGoblin I missed it out because I don't feel its integral to the saga story. Rogue One tells a key part of the story but Solo does not.

@niall_gooch RO is the second-best thing since the original trilogy, and Solo is very respectable. (I would probably put the Filoni cartoons above Solo.) Mandalorian is - 5 eps in of our watch-thru - comfortably in that top tier.

@marxculture It's the dollars trilogy - in spaaace. Sort of. Star wars is best echoing genre films in spaaace and not being star wars. Original trilogy as swords and sorcery, rogue one as ww2 dirty dozen, mandalorian as spaghetti western.

@pickassoreborn They are also paid attention to the good bits of SW. Sure, R1 and Solo weren't necessary, but they were great fun.

@3hrs_later The fight scene in the Throne room felt like a slapstick comedy scene from 1960s Batman. I absolutely love Martial Arts and it did not feel like a deadly duel what so ever. It was laughable and comical. What did you think about the #Mandalorian TV show?	2020-04-27T16:45:56Z	twitter	1	General Disney + & Mandalorian Discussions	blue
Have really enjoyed The Mandalorian, so don't think Disney deserve some of the flank they get. I think John Favreau, Dave Filoni and Gareth Edwards really get Star Wars and hope they will push the franchise forward. Rebels and Rogue One are up there with Empire and A New Hope. https://t.co/Np98u2qorw	2020-04-27T16:52:43Z	twitter	7	Star Wars Universe	blue
@BenedictTown not saying they can't have deeper subtext etc, but just that they're incredibly focused. I'd say the Mandalorian is good at this.	2020-04-27T16:52:59Z	twitter	1	General Disney + & Mandalorian Discussions	blue

@JoKepler - memorable. But I think, as we're seeing with other franchises (Game Of Thrones, Star Wars) - bad products see a downturn in popularity.

The Mandalorian is quite simply, just okay. It leans so hard on nostalgia it entirely forgets to have an engrossing narrative.

Finally! So many months later than everyone else, I have finished The Mandalorian season 1. Well worth the wait; it's not quite must-see, media-redefining appointment TV in the Game of Thrones vein, but it certainly is some real prime cut Star Wars, and that's what I want. https://t.co/3zo8QRvfax	2020-05-02T00:50:17Z	twitter	1	Star Wars Universe	blue
None of The Mandalorian S1 quite reaches the very best of The Clone Wars, but only because it's still too early (or expensive?) for The Mandalorian to match that same epic sweep, or to cash out on the same level of character investment. Of course, that may be partly by design.	2020-05-02T00:50:18Z	twitter	1	Star Wars Universe	blue
I'm definitely sold on the grittier, more intimate scale, especially after the empty-calorie operatic excess of Rise of Skywalker. By focusing in on lived-in detail, The Mandalorian restores the sense of credible history and geography to Star Wars that the sequel trilogy lacked.	2020-05-02T00:50:18Z	twitter	1	Star Wars Universe	blue
It seemed clear early on that Lucasfilm would be using The Mandalorian as an incubator for the next generation of Star Wars directorial talent, and I'd say that experiment was a complete success. Let Jon Favreau and Dave Filoni take the lead, they know what they're doing.	2020-05-02T00:50:20Z	twitter	1	Star Wars Universe	blue
Overall, The Mandalorian is a great palate-cleanser after the missteps of Solo and Rise of Skywalker, and points to some rich new territory for Star Wars to explore. Looking forward to catching up with Clone Wars again, now that this one's over; that's an exciting prospect!	2020-05-02T00:50:21Z	twitter	1	Star Wars Universe	blue
Happy to hear they've already renewed Mandalorian for season 3; a show like this could run for a while, and I'd love to see them take the time to flesh out that hazy, lawless post-Return of the Jedi story void.

#TheMandalorian has aired fully in the UK, and overall it's been great. After feeling disheartened by TROS, the Mandalorian has restored my faith in the potential of good live-action Star Wars.

@AhsokaTanooSW I kinda prefer The Mandalorian to be honest. Some of the clone wars episodes are good but there are 7 seasons of it could’ve really shrunk down to about 4 or 5 as some episodes seem so stretched and pointless. A bit like Rebels.

That #Mandalorian finale is directed by Taika Waititi. I enjoyed some of the action, but it's got tons of the plot loopholes. How did Disney heads allow this? I'd ignore a few, but it's just one after another. Was this really the best they could do? Kuiil didn't die for this!	2020-05-03T00:03:32Z	twitter	0	General Disney + & Mandalorian Discussions	blue

@Captainbudd3r16 @SW_Fanatics1977 @nicolas_s27 @_Dooku_Tyranus @starwarstuff @disneyplus Both the prequels and the sequels have bad writing.

@TheBatSaber The series could alternate between narrative points, going back & forth with the time between clone wars & rebels & then dealing with after episode 6.

@swyx @markdalgleish What’d y’all think of the Mandalorian? I enjoyed it, but it didn’t feel very “Star Wars” to me.

The Mandalorian is the best thing to happen to Star Wars since the original trilogy. Loved all of the references, easter eggs, re-used props. Felt organic not just fan service.

@125framesphotos @JoshuaLevett No complaints about the lack of CGI, prefer that approach (like The Mandalorian - which I'd is better than all but Empire and Jedi). I think New Hope's script is a bit poor and the pacing is off. It's a good film, not a great one.

My only real Star Wars opinion on Star Wars day is that Rogue one and Mandalorian are the best things released since the original trilogy because they're adapting other genres to the SW world, where as everything else is trying very hard to be a Star Wars thing.	2020-05-04T09:04:27Z	twitter	1	Star Wars Universe	blue

@TheUrbanGorilla Yeah, although it's one of my favourite film sagas - it has more average/good films than great ones, sadly. Agreed on New Hope, pacing is poor.

Ah yes ???? #HappyStarWarsDay Btw my favourite Star Wars movie is Rogue One. I don’t really like any of the actual Star Wars movies. But I did quite enjoy The Mandalorian. Don’t know what that means. https://t.co/zw1pMvCqJN	2020-05-04T09:17:12Z	twitter	0	Star Wars Universe	blue
Other than the sequels, these are the way I like to partner up my Star Wars viewings: Rogue One with Star Wars, Solo with The Empire Strikes Back, Return of the Jedi with The Mandalorian. They pair up well as double bills. #MayThe4thBeWithYou https://t.co/qdTLzy0Rnc	2020-05-04T09:17:31Z	twitter	0	Star Wars Universe	blue
@TheOnlyJakeEver I watched the original trilogy quite late, knowing pretty much everything, but darn if I didn't love every minute of Empire Strikes Back, haha. It's worth it just for more Harrison Han Solo ?? Have you seen The Mandalorian?	2020-05-04T09:17:36Z	twitter	1	General Disney + & Mandalorian Discussions	blue
@IamHappyToast Exactly. Outside of A New Hope and ESB only Force Awakens, Last Jedi, TROS, Rogue One, Solo and The Mandalorian are the best things to happen to Star Wars. But that’s all really. Pah.	2020-05-04T09:18:48Z	twitter	0	Star Wars Universe	blue

@MarienneMaid The sequel trilogy may have blown it, but there's so much great SW being made at the moment - The Mandalorian, Clone Wars, some great book and comics, Jedi Fallen Order. The dark side can be beaten with some good writers and directors and a bit of vision.	2020-05-04T11:23:07Z	twitter	1	Star Wars Universe	blue

These seem like very solid appointments! I had reservations about Waititi - I didn't care for Jojo Rabbit, and thought Thor Ragnarok was probably too flippant as a model for a Star Wars film - but the sheer excellence of his Mandalorian season 1 finale has really reassured me.	2020-05-04T17:09:38Z	twitter	2	Star Wars Universe	blue

Happy Star Wars Day. Watch The Mandalorian, it's the best thing to come out of the IP since Empire. Clone Wars is also surprisingly good (it gets better after Season 1, can comfortably skip.)

I contend that, for as bad as the prequels are, they reach that level of 'so bad they're good' plus better fight choreography.

I loved Rian Johnson's film, I didn't care for many of the others, I'm lukewarm on what I've seen of The Mandalorian, but none of these seem like indicators of quality for whatever comes next.	2020-05-05T09:37:38Z	twitter	1	General Disney + & Mandalorian Discussions	blue

@philip_stokoe @editmonkey The Mandalorian’s fantastic. Easily the best thing since ROTJ. I loved almost all of Rogue One except the attack on the base , which we’ve seen a hundred times before. When it’s being a grimy war film it’s great.	2020-05-05T15:47:37Z	twitter	2	Recommending Shows to Watch Next	blue

Alright. I finished watching Episodes 1 & 2 of the Mandalorian. It's very interesting I have to say. I like how it mainly focuses on the minor elements of the series like the monsters and the bounty hunters. Episode 1 was a bit slow but episode 2 was good.	2020-05-05T22:45:19Z	twitter	0	General Disney + & Mandalorian Discussions	blue

As I’ve said, the Clone Wars flavour of The Mandalorian is a huge aspect of why I like it; with Ahsoka and at least one clone now showing up, that will only deepen! And if it IS Boba Fett... well! Looking forward to seeing him get on-screen development for the first time!	2020-05-08T20:56:51Z	twitter	1	Star Wars Universe	blue
Whilst I do think there is a genuine story thread from Rebels that would merit Ahsoka's inclusion in Mandalorian, I do hope it's fairly minimalist. I think Mandalorian & Bounty Hunter characters from Clone Wars/Rebels should get more of a spotlight. Bane, Bo-Katan, Highsinger etc	2020-05-08T20:58:46Z	twitter	1	Star Wars Universe	blue

Like, as much as I didn't like the barging in of Clone Wars to Rebels, if the right elements of the two end up in The Mandalorian then it wouldn't be as bad. Just so long as they treat them as if they only turned up for the first time.	2020-05-08T22:40:47Z	twitter	0	Star Wars Universe	blue
@tomchadwin @DaveClark_AFP Just watched rebel one; I thought it was brilliant as a Star Wars film. The plots & emotions were never complex but I loved “finding clues and moving on to the next scene”.

@VoyageOfDameron Hugely disagree. Dave has an immense understanding of how Star Wars storytelling works. He was an apprentice to George Lucas. Rian Johnson made a beautiful looking movie, but as Star Wars content I cannot find it as good as the Clone Wars, Solo or Mandalorian.	2020-05-11T01:21:56Z	twitter	0	Star Wars Universe	blue

This feels like a totally natural addition, especially based on season 1’s cliffhanger, and the casting is a obvious gimme.

@NanoRdz2020 Don't think so. Maul is dead by the time of the Mandalorian. The Darksaber tease is a link to Bo-Katan. Sabine trained with the Darksaber in rebels and left it in the hands of Bo.

This needs to be made into a huge open world role playing game. #StarWars #TheMandalorian	2020-05-12T21:19:13Z	twitter	1	Star Wars Universe	blue

@BristowMyko5 @lfcjamie The last 2 were very good. I did really like the prison break episode, but found it to be the most predictable ep of the series. Some really good scenes in it though. Got to say, the Mandalorian, if it wasn’t for his armour and allies, would have died ten times in each episode.	2020-05-14T07:08:01Z	twitter	0	General Disney + & Mandalorian Discussions	blue

@T3ddyJ0nes @pcgamer Well it also had more than 2000 times the amount of geometry than is on screen at any point in the new modern warfare game for comparison.

@WilIHYDE @BenMauro993 Yeah, films and TV series absolutely (look at how Mandalorian used it in their environments). Pre-rendered movies in games will definitely decline. Its cheaper at this point to just use the in game assets real-time then render out 4k movies (in terms of the space video uses).	2020-05-14T22:30:52Z	twitter	1	Recommending Shows to Watch Next	blue

@MJ_FERMEZ_LA @SW_takes Bo always seemed younger to me, the little sister rebelling against her older, wiser sibling, until the takeover of Mandalore where she had to grow up.

@peachpadme I saw your take about the Mandalorian being a Clone Wars reunion and it was so right. Star Wars takes are based. Other takes are probably good too, I just haven't really seen them. Also, great Twitch streams.	2020-05-14T22:45:05Z	twitter	2	Star Wars Universe	blue

I enjoyed The Mandalorian, but the scene in the first episode with the caged Kowakian monkey-lizard watching them spit roast and eat another, and you can see its eyes it knows its fate.
